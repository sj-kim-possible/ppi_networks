Abstract
Free-living bacteria adapt toenvironmental change byreprogramming gene expression
through precise interactions ofhundreds ofDNA-bindi ngproteins. Apredictive understand-
ingofbacterial physiology requires ustoglobally monitor allsuch protein–DNA interactions
across arange ofenvironmen talandgenetic perturbations. Here, weshow thatsuch global
observations arepossible using anoptimized version ofinvivoprotein occupancy display
technology (invivoprotein occupancy display—hig hresolution, IPOD-HR) andpresent a
pilotapplication toEscherichia coli.Weobserve thattheE.coliprotein–DNA interactome
organizes into2distinct prototypic features: (1)highly dynamic condition-dependent tran-
scription factor (TF)occupancy; and(2)robust kilobase scale occupancy bynucleoid fac-
tors, forming silencing domains analogous toeukaryotic heterochromatin. Weshow that
occupancy dynamics across arange ofconditions canrapidly reveal theglobal transcrip-
tional regulatory organization ofabacterium. Beyond discovery ofpreviously hidden regula-
torylogic, weshow thatthese observations canbeutilized tocomputationally determine
sequence specificity models forthemajority ofactive TFs. Ourstudy demonstrates that
global observations ofprotein occupancy combined withstatistical inference canrapidly and
systematically reveal thetranscriptional regulatory andstructural features ofabacterial
genome. Thiscapacity isparticularly crucial fornon-mode lbacteria thatarenotamenable to
routine genetic manipulation.
Introduction
Transcriptional regulation plays acentral role inestablishing adaptive gene expression states.
Inbacteria, thedominant regulators aretranscription factors (TFs) [1,2] and sigma factors,
which direct theactivity ofRNA polymerase holoenzyme toaspecific subset ofpromoters
[3,4]. The phenotypic state ofthebacterial cellisdetermined inlarge part byitstranscriptional

across thechromosome, likely ininterplay with structural factors such asthelocal supercoiling
state [5].
Atpresent, however, ourknowledge ofthecomplete wiring ofbacterial transcriptional reg-
ulatory networks remains insufficient tofully predict ordesign regulatory responses toarbi-
trary environmental conditions. The case ofEscherichia coliserves asanillustrative case study:
Due toitsstatus asapreeminent model organism and important human pathogen, theE.coli
transcriptional regulatory network hasbeen anintense subject ofinvestigation forseveral
decades. Asaresult, researchers have obtained anincreasingly comprehensive and detailed
map ofthebinding specificities and physiological roles oftranscriptional regulators inthis
organism [6].However, roughly onequarter oftheapproximately 250TFs inE.colihave no
available binding orregulatory data [7],and many more arevirtual unknowns interms ofthe
signals that might alter their regulatory activity. Likely asaresult ofthisknowledge gap, Larsen
and colleagues recently found that despite ourbroad knowledge ofthepotential regulatory tar-
gets ofE.coliTFs, ourability topredict regulatory behavior onthebasis ofexpression levels of
TFs isnobetter than itwould beforrandom networks. The authors attribute thispartly tothe
factthat even when aTFisexpressed, inmany cases, itwillnotbind itstargets intheabsence
ofadditional signals [8].Furthermore, E.colirepresents abest-case scenario interms ofour
knowledge state forabacterial transcriptional regulatory network and formost bacterial spe-
ciescurrent databases lagfarbehind.
Expanding ourcapability topredict, and ultimately design, bacterial regulatory responses
willbecritical forcontrolling bacterial pathogenesis and engineering synthetic microbes in
biotechnology applications. Achieving such acomplete predictive understanding, however,
requires substantial additional information both onthebinding sites ofas-yet uncharacterized
TFs and theactual physical occupancy ofsites forboth known and uncharacterized factors
across conditions. Widely used methods such aschromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing
(ChIP-seq) pose difficulties onboth fronts: They demand acombinatorial explosion ofexperi-
ments tostudy many TFs across avariety ofconditions and require either anantibody against
each TFofinterest orgenetic manipulation sufficient toaddanepitope tagtoeach target TF.
Inorder tosignificantly advance ourunderstanding oftranscriptional network dynamics
and chromosomal structure, wesought tomonitor, inparallel, theoccupancy states ofall
DNA-binding proteins across asetofgenetic and environmental perturbations. Weargue that
such comprehensive observations arecritical fordefining theglobal modes oftranscriptional
regulation and determining theregulatory logic that underlies adaptive reprogramming of
gene expression, particularly given theimportance ofcombinatorial logic bymany factors and
sites indictating transcriptional output [9].Inorder toachieve ourgoal, wedecided toemploy
theconcept ofinvivo protein occupancy display (IPOD) which we,inaprevious proof-of-
concept study, demonstrated toreveal global occupancy ofprotein binding sites across theE.
colichromosome [10]. However, wehadtointroduce critical modifications and enhancements
inorder todeconvolve distinct contributions from sequence-specific TFs and RNA polymer-
aseand define binding sites athigh resolution. Wewillrefer tothissecond-generation IPOD
technology asinvivo protein occupancy display—high resolution (IPOD-HR). IPOD-HR
enables efficient coverage ofalarge range ofphysiological conditions inrelatively fewexperi-
ments (1experiment percondition, rather than the1experiment perTFpercondition that
would berequired forChIP-seq). Aswedemonstrate below, asingle IPOD-HR experiment
canreveal theoccupancy dynamics ofdozens ofknown and novel active TFs genome-wide,
permitting rapid profiling ofglobal transcriptional regulatory logic across different conditions.
Furthermore, thecomprehensive nature ofIPOD-HR profiles enables efficient statistical infer-
ence ofsequence specificity models (transcription factor binding site[TFBS] motifs) foractive

Here, wecharacterized thedynamics oftheglobal protein–DNA interactome ofE.coli
across arange of3physiological conditions and 3genetic perturbations. Our observations
allowed ustoinfer, inparallel, theactivities ofmost annotated TFs across conditions, and pro-
vided acatalog ofmany additional likely regulatory sites and DNA sequence motifs for
uncharacterized TFs. With thecompact setofexperiments, wereveal thedramatic regulatory
dynamics ofdozens ofTFs that collectively shape theresponse ofE.colitochanging environ-
ments. Insharp contrast, wefind that atthekilobase scale, thegenome ischaracterized byaset
ofrelatively static structural domains, which consist oftranscriptionally silent lociwith dense
protein occupancy that appear mostly constitutive across arange ofphysiological conditions.
These regions, which werefer toasextended protein occupancy domains (EPODs) following
thenomenclature ofVora and colleagues [10], appear toact,atleast partially, tosuppress pro-
phages and mobile genetic elements.
Because ourapproach does notrelyonprior knowledge ofTFsofinterest orgenetic manip-
ulation ofthetarget organism, butrather only onessential physicochemical properties ofpro-
tein–DNA complexes, weexpect that itwillbebroadly applicable across bacterial species, even
those which cannot becultured orgenetically manipulated. Our approach lays thetechnical
and analytic foundation torapidly characterize theregulatory and structural features ofany
bacterial chromosomes.
Results
Global high-resolution profiling ofcondition-dependent transcription
factor occupancy across theE.coli chromosome
The IPOD-HR procedure isshown inschematic form inFig1A:Cells aregrown under aphys-
iological condition ofinterest, fixed using formaldehyde, and then lysed. Heavy digestion of
thechromosomal DNA provides minimized DNA fragments that may beineither aprotein
bound orunbound state. The protein bound DNA fragments aresubsequently isolated using a
phenol–chloroform extraction. Under appropriate buffer conditions, theamphipathic pro-
tein–DNA complexes aredepleted from theaqueous phase and partition toarobust disc atthe
aqueous–organic interface [10].
Aswewilldemonstrate below, themeasurements enabled byIPOD-HR cansubsequently
beused forabroad range ofdownstream analyses, such assimultaneous monitoring ofthe
activities ofcharacterized TFs, large-scale inference ofbinding motifs forpreviously uncharac-
terized DNA-binding proteins, and identification ofkeyoccupancy sites driving previously
unrecognized gene regulatory logic. Toaccomplish these objectives, itisessential toseparate
outtheoccupancy signal ofRNA polymerase from that ofspecific regulatory factors ofinter-
est.Otherwise, thestrong occupancy signal caused byRNA polymerase could mask changes in
protein occupancy that infactprovide regulatory information. Todeconvolve occupancy
caused bysequence-specific TFs and that ofRNA polymerase, wesubtract thenormalized
RNA polymerase ChIP-seq signal from that ofthenormalized rawIPOD-HR signal (see Meth-
odsfordetails), generating acorrected IPOD-HR profile that isamore precise representation
ofthecell’s dynamic regulatory state (Fig 1B). IPOD-HR isconceptually similar totheoriginal
IPOD method [10] interms ofoverall workflow, butcontains critical optimizations and exten-
sions designed topermit genome-wide identification ofbinding byTFs and organizing factors
such asnucleoid-associated proteins inacondition-specific manner. Ontheexperimental end,
IPOD-HR incorporates amore stringent washing procedure (the inclusion ofaTris base wash

minimize thecontributions ofRNA polymerase occupancy totheobserved signal, and an
RNA polymerase ChIP-seq experiment inparallel toallow separation ofRNA polymerase
occupancy from that ofother proteins (more information ontheinterplay ofRNA polymerase
occupancy and that ofother proteins isgiven inS1Text). Onthecomputational end,
IPOD-HR makes useofacompletely rewritten analysis pipeline (asdetailed inMethods) that
provides proper adjustment forRNA polymerase occupancy, gives anintegrated workflow for
calculation oftotal protein occupancy (including uncertainty estimates), and allows forthe
identification ofkeyoccupancy features such asoccupancy peaks corresponding toindividual
binding sites, aswell aslarge regions ofhigh protein occupancy that actassilencing complexes
ontheE.coligenome.
Wenote inpassing that, atfirst glance, IPOD may seem toshare superficial similarities
with formaldehyde-assisted isolation ofregulatory elements (FAIRE, originally described in
[11]). However, FAIRE experiments were designed todetect regions ofnucleosome-depleted
DNA ineukaryotic chromosomes. IPOD wasindependently developed todetect occupancy of
individual factors inprokaryotic chromosomes [10], and IPOD-HR contains further optimiza-
tions and additional experimental and computational steps toimprove performance indetect-
ingboth localized and large-scale protein occupancy inbacteria.
Anillustrative example oftheability ofIPOD-HR toidentify regulatory protein occupancy,
itsdynamics across conditions, and theimportance offactoring outtheRNA polymerase sig-
nalisshown inFig1C.Weconsider theIPOD-HR occupancy profiles forthepromoter region
upstream ofthepurC gene inwild-type (WT) and ΔpurR cells during growth inrich defined
medium (RDM). Based onthecharacterized behavior ofPurR (which binds DNA inresponse
toexogenous purine supplementation [12,13]), under thisgrowth condition, transcription of
purC should berepressed bybinding ofPurR toitspromoter. However, ifoneconsiders only
therawIPOD-HR occupancy profiles (top panel), binding tothePurR siteinthisregion is
apparent inboth WT and ΔpurR cells. The resolution tothisseeming paradox becomes appar-
entthrough inclusion ofthecorrection forRNA polymerase occupancy (middle panel), which
issubstantially higher in ΔpurR cells. Asexpected, theresulting corrected IPOD-HR occu-
pancy profiles (bottom panel) reveal aprotein occupancy peak directly ontopoftheannotated
PurR binding siteinthisregion intheWT cells, and nodetectable occupancy inthe ΔpurR
cells. This demonstrates theability ofIPOD-HR toreveal condition-dependent TFoccupancy
dynamics even inregions that may overlap with RNA polymerase binding. Inthefollowing
sections, IPOD-HR refers totheRNA polymerase–corrected occupancy signal, unless other-
wise noted.

observed many large-scale (>1 kb)regions ofhigh occupancy, which werefer toasEPODs,
following thenomenclature ofVora and colleagues [10]. Anexample ofcondition-dependent
changes inbinding oflocal TFs isshown inFig2Band 2C.Examination ofanapproximately
50-kb slice ofthegenome reveals dozens ofsmall occupancy peaks, with avisually apparent
enrichment inintergenic regions (Fig 2B). Many such peaks, which presumably correspond to
individual protein binding events, coincide with known TFBSs. Forexample, theregion
upstream ofargA (Fig 2C) shows strong occupancy atknown ArgR binding sites and condi-
tion-appropriate occupancy dynamics including weakening ofbinding inarginine-poor con-
ditions [14,15] and lossofoccupancy upon deletion oftheargR gene. Atthesame time, similar
occupancy patterns canbeobserved atmany sites lacking anannotated TFBS, asseen inFig
2D,where aconditionally dynamic binding siteisapparent between lysA andlysR and acon-
stitutive binding siteinthelysA gene body. This dynamic sitebetween thegenes likely corre-
sponds tobinding ofLysR itself inourminimal media condition, asLysR isknown tobind
somewhere intheregion justupstream oflysR torepress transcription oflysR and activate
transcription oflysA [16], buttheprecise location ofthebinding sitehasnotpreviously been
determined toourknowledge, and thus itsexact coordinates arenotpresent incommon data-
bases such asRegulonDB [7].Tofacilitate inspection ofother regions ofinterest, weprovide
complete occupancy traces fortheconditions studied inS1Data. Asexpected, atagenome-
wide scale IPOD-HR signals show both significantly higher occupancy inintergenic regions
relative tocoding regions and significantly higher occupancy atannotated TFBSs relative to
other regions ofthechromosome (Fig 2E;seealso S1Table), demonstrating astrong overlap
oftheobserved protein occupancy with transcriptional regulatory sites. Indeed, applying peak
calling totheIPOD-HR signal demonstrates anincreasingly strong overlap with known TFBSs
asthethreshold forpeak calling isincreased (S1Fig; afulllisting ofpeak calls isgiven inS2
Data).
Itisalso apparent byinspection ofthegenome-wide occupancy shown inFig2Athat many
extended regions ofhigh protein occupancy coincide with regions ofrelatively lowtranscrip-
tion. Forexample, inFig2F,weshow atypical approximately 300-kb region with alternating
segments ofhigh protein occupancy that have relatively lowtranscription, with those oflow
protein occupancy and relatively high transcription (also apparent inthehigher-resolution
plot inFig2G). Thus, inaddition torevealing occupancy atthelevel ofindividual regulatory
sites, IPOD-HR enables tracking ofthebehavior oflarge, densely protein occupied regions of
thechromosome that appear tocoincide with transcriptionally silent loci. Wewillexplore
both ofthese prototypic classes ofoccupancy, inmore detail, below.
Transcription factor and sigma factor occupancy dynamics across genetic
and environmental perturbations
Since IPOD-HR occupancy profiles show highly enriched overlaps with known TFBSs (Fig
2E), weasked whether IPOD-HR profiles canbeused toreveal theoccupancy dynamics for
knownE.coliTFs across asetofconditions. Indeed, wefind that IPOD-HR reveals consistent
and condition-appropriate regulatory logic atthelevel ofindividual regulons and patterns ofand total RNA abundance (orange) foraselected sector ofthegenome (wedge iifrom panel A),showing thepresence ofseveral EPODs inregions correspond ingtolow

(argR,lexA, andpurR) show global lossofoccupancy attheensemble ofannotated sites forthe
corresponding TFs (Fig 3A) relative togrowth under equivalent conditions ofWT cells (WT,
rich). Analysis ofcondition-dependent changes intheoccupancy ofbinding sites forsingle
TFs likewise recapitulates expected behavior; forexample, ArgR [17] and PurR [12,18] show
enhanced binding toDNA inthepresence ofamino acid ornucleobase ligands that aresup-
plied directly inourrich media conditions, and theIPOD-HR occupancy signal shows global
lossofoccupancy forbinding sites ofboth ofthese TFs innutrient-depleted conditions (mini-
mal media) when compared with exponential growth inrich media (Fig 3A). Incontrast,
RutR shows increased overall occupancy inminimal media relative torich media conditions,
consistent with theknown inhibition ofRutR binding bythymine and uracil [19]; similar
behavior isobserved forthecytidine-responsive CytR [20,21]. Sites forArcA, which becomes
active under lowoxygen conditions [22,23], show strong increases inoccupancy instationary
phase athigh culture density (Fig 3A). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that
IPOD-HR provides aquantitative readout ofchanges inregulatory activity across abroad
range ofphysiological and genetic perturbations.
The utility ofIPOD-HR intracking theoccupancy ofknown binding sites extends toglobal
regulators with large characterized regulons; forexample, comparison oftheoccupancy at
annotated Lrpbinding sites observed inIPOD-HR data totheoccupancy ofLrpitself atthe
same sites inLrpChIP-seq data under similar conditions shows asignificantly more similar
occupancy profile than isseen forother TFs with large regulons (Fig 3B), aswould beexpected
iftheIPOD-HR profile were tracking Lrpoccupancy across conditions. Importantly, thiscon-
cordance ismaintained even inthepresence ofmany other occupancy changes being mea-
sured forother proteins atlocations throughout thegenome, and potential interference from
other factors binding tosites overlapping theLrpsites.
Similar insights canbeobtained across theE.colitranscriptional regulatory network by
extending ouranalysis toallcharacterized TFBSs annotated inRegulonDB [7];weshow the
resulting condition-dependent occupancies inpanel AofS2Fig. Asisapparent from theraw
occupancies, E.coliTFs differ substantially from each other inthestrength oftheIPOD-HR
footprint that they generate (leading, forexample, tothevery strong signals forfactors such as
IdnR). Across theconditions inourstudy, 122outofthe176TFs inRegulonDB hadatleast 1
sitewith detectable occupancy (robust z-score>3), and thus weareable toprovide data onthe
characterized binding sites forthemajority ofTFs inE.coli. The remaining TFs likely repre-
sent acombination offactors that arenotexpressed oractive under thelimited setofcondi-
tions that weconsidered and those that cannot becross-linked efficiently toDNA by
formaldehyde (e.g., Lacrepressor, which waspreviously shown nottocross-link effectively to
DNA with formaldehyde [26], and does notshow substantial IPOD-HR signal) ordonotpar-
tition appropriately inthephenol–chloroform extraction. Forthemajority offactors showing
detectable occupancy, condition-dependent dynamics canbeobserved most clearly bynor-
malizing theTFlevel occupancy bythehighest occupancy condition observed forthat factor
(S2Fig, panel B).
Byapplying anunsupervised clustering approach (see Methods fordetails), weidentified
transcriptional regulatory modules that show consistent co-regulation across theconditions in
ourstudy. Wefound clustering ofTFs with highly similar behavior (Fig 3C) that coordinate,

clustered were almost equally likely tohave anonzero Jaccard index (and thus share atleast
some regulatory targets) than were TFpairs from different clusters (odds ratio 0.95,p=0.76,
Fisher exact test). Thus, co-clustering appears toreflect different TFs that have similar condi-
tion-dependent occupancy profiles, rather than factors that regulate identical targets (likely
minimizing redundancy ofregulatory information infavor ofcombinatorial regulation ofa
single target byfactors that each sense different stimuli). Weexpect that substantially more
insight into these patterns may beobtained inthefuture through application ofIPOD-HR toa
broader array ofconditions.
Wethus find that IPOD-HR occupancy profiles canprovide detailed, site-level, condition-
specific information onregulatory protein occupancy across theentire chromosome. Bycom-
paring changes inprotein occupancy with changes intranscript levels across conditions, we
canrelate changes inprotein occupancy totheir positive ornegative regulatory consequences.
This canbeseen for2nutrient-sensing transcriptional repressors with sites annotated inRegu-
lonDB, ArgR, and PurR, across changes innutrient conditions (Fig 3D). The changes inpro-
tein occupancy and regulatory output atthese sites show that forboth factors, there isastrong
lossofprotein occupancy atrepressive ArgR and PurR sites and acorresponding increase in
transcriptional output inregulated genes, when considering minimal media relative torich
media.
Since each IPOD-HR global protein occupancy data setisperformed alongside anRNA
polymerase ChIP-seq experiment, wecaneasily track promoter occupancy alongside TFBS
occupancy. The useofrifampin permits transcriptional initiation, butprevents elongation past
afewnucleotides [27]. Thus, these data setsareideal foridentifying regulation atthelevel of
RNA polymerase (e.g., viadifferent sigma factors). The differential patterns ofRNA polymer-
aseoccupancy show strong correlations with transcript levels foreach sigma factor’s regulon
across arange ofconditions. Asshown inFig3E,when comparing logarithmic versus station-
aryphase conditions, thechanges intranscript abundance and RNA polymerase promoter
occupancy show aSpearman correlation of0.94 (p=0.005); anequivalent comparison for
changes inoccupancy versus expression forcells grown inminimal media yields similar results
(Spearman correlation 0.77,p=0.072).
Inaddition torevealing theoccupancy ofindividual, well-separated TFBSs, IPOD-HR
occupancy canalso yield insight into TFbehavior atregulatory regions bound bymultiple fac-
tors. Anexample isshown inFig3FforthepotF promoter, which contains closely spaced Lrp,
ArcA, and ArgR binding sites. The observed occupancy profile appears decomposable into a
contribution from Lrpbinding (strong inminimal media and moderate intheRDM condi-
tions), ArgR binding (strongest inrich media, moderate instationary phase RDM and inmini-
mal media, and absent in ΔargR cells), and ArcA binding (mainly instationary phase).
Binding oftheLrpsiteatthepotF promoter isknown tobestrongest inminimal media andconditions. Drawn TFBSs aretaken from Ecocyc [25] reflecting recent updates inknown TFBSs inthisregion. (G)IPOD-HR occupancy profiles upstream of

thebroad occupancy around theannotated Lrpsiteislikely duetoweaker binding ofother
sites from theLrpoctamer. The inferred behaviors ofArgR and ArcA binding arelikewise
consistent with theoverall behavior ofsites forthose TFs inourexperiments (Fig 3A, S2Fig).
Amore complex example canbeseen inFig3G,where weshow thendh promoter containing

moter appear likely tobeIHF and PdhR inthe“WT,rich” condition, IHF and NsrR inthe
“WT,minimal” condition, and NsrR and ArcA inthe“WT,stationary” condition. However,
assignments ofoccupancy tospecific factors atsuch acomplex promoter cannot bemade with
certainty onthebasis ofIPOD-HR data alone; combination with ChIP data under similar con-
ditions (asinvoked inthediscussion above forFig3F)canaidinassignment, ascould more
formal methods fordeconvolving theprotein occupancy signal based ontheoverall distribu-
tion ofsites foreach factor across thegenome (similar totheapproach taken byCENTIPEDE

Global occupancy dynamics reveals theaction ofnew DNA-binding
proteins
Despite extensive annotation efforts, atpresent, fewer than 1,100 ofthe3,560 annotated tran-
scriptional units present intheRegulonDB database have anyannotated regulation byTFs
assigned tothem [7].While several recent notable efforts have sought toexpand thecomplete-
ness ofthese regulatory annotations bystudying theDNA-binding preferences ofpurified TFs
[6,29,30], orviacomputational inference oflikely additional regulation [31] and regulatory
modules [32], none ofthese methods provides either direct evidence forbinding invivo or
information oncondition-dependent changes inoccupancy. IPOD-HR, incontrast, canpro-
vide both. Furthermore, theprotein occupancy signals thus obtained provide information on
occupancy ofboth well-characterized and uncharacterized proteins. Infact, many dynamic
IPOD-HR peaks occur inpromoters with noprevious annotation forTFBSs, aswewilldiscuss
indetail inthefollowing section.
Arepresentative example ofanorphan occupancy peak isseen upstream ofthegenesdaC
(Fig 4).InourRNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data,sdaC transcript levels arenearly 20-fold
higher during exponential growth inrich media (317.3 transcripts permillion [TPM]) com-
pared with either exponential growth inminimal media (17.9 TPM) orstationary phase inrich
media (16.7 TPM). IPOD-HR occupancy profiles (Fig 4A) show alikely transcriptional activa-
torbinding siteupstream ofthesdaC core promoter, which shows strong occupancy inthe
WT M9/RDM/glu conditions butnottherelated conditions wheresdaC expression islower;
incontrast, theonly annotated TFBS inthat region isarepressive Lrpsite200bpdownstream
oftheoccupancy peak. Toidentify theTF(s) responsible forthat occupancy, weused abiotiny-
lated bait DNA matching thesequence ofthesdaC promoter region toisolate proteins bound
tothat region fromE.colicells grown intheWT M9/RDM/glu condition (Fig 4B). Mass spec-
trometry onisolated bait-dependent bands revealed 2poorly characterized TFs, UlaR and
YieP, which showed highly enriched binding tothesdaC promoter (see S3Table). While UlaR
proved difficult topurify duetopoor solubility and wasthus excluded from further analysis,
wefound that purified YieP does indeed show specific shifting ofthesdaC promoter inanelec-
trophoretic mobility shift assay (Fig 4C). Consistently, recent RNA-seq data onaΔyieP strain

isogenic cells with aplasmid-born reintroduction ofYieP during growth inLBmedia (per-
sonal communication, C.Bianco and C.Vanderpool).
YieP wasrecently (and independently) selected byPalsson and colleagues asavalidation
case tobeused intheir consideration ofcomputational methods foridentifying thebinding
sites oforphan TFs and subjected toChIP-exo analysis oncells grown inglucose minimal
media using epitope-tagged YieP [31]. Indeed, their data demonstrate both strong direct YieP
occupancy, and ahigh confidence YieP motif match, attheprecise position oftheoccupancy
peak detected inourIPOD-HR data set(Fig 4D). Based ontherelative intensity atthat posi-
tion across conditions, combined with theexpression data noted above, weinfer that YieP
binds tothesdaC promoter innutrient-replete conditions and acts asatranscriptional activa-
tor(explaining thesolitary strong peak inour“WT,rich” condition), whereas inother condi-
tions, YieP binding isweakened (but notabolished), and additional factors such asLrplikely
bind downstream oftheYieP sitetorepresssdaC transcription.
Wemust emphasize that thediscovery ofYieP binding sites through IPOD-HR and subse-
quent mass spectrometry experiments (byus)occurred inparallel with theChIP-exo experi-
ments ofGao and colleagues, and, indeed, represent highly complementary paths for
identification ofthebinding sites fororphan TFs, with onecentered onacandidate protein
and theother oncandidate sites.
Inorder todirectly assess theregulatory role oftheidentified YieP binding sites, weinte-
grated alacZ reporter atthearaBAD-araC locus inboth WT and ΔyieP backgrounds, driven
byvariants ofthesdaC promoter that either match theoriginal sequence, orhave 1orboth
YieP binding sites scrambled (see Methods fordetails). Consistent with theRNA-seq data
described above, weobserved that deletion ofyieP leads toasignificant drop inreporter activ-
itywith theWTsdaC promoter (Fig 4E,“WTsdaCp”). Interpretation ofthesingle-site scram-
bles iscomplicated bythefactthat thepromoter variants appear tohave substantively different
effects intheWT andyieP backgrounds; however, what isclear isthat removal ofboth YieP
binding sites (Fig 4E,“Site 1/2scramble”) leads toadrop inreporter activity intheWT back-
ground that isvirtually identical tothat observed with deletion ofyieP, whereas inayieP back-
ground, there isinstead asignificant increase inreporter activity when thesites arescrambled.Fig4.Experimenta lidentifica tion oftheprotein bound toanovel occupancy peak upstream ofthesdaC

PLOS Biology |https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.pb io.3001306 June 25,2021 13/42The sign epistasis observed between yieP genotype and thepresence ofYieP sites atthesdaC
promoter argues that theobserved YieP binding sites arefunctional regulatory sites, butthat
YieP also acts indirectly atthispromoter (either through alterations ofcellular physiology in
theyieP background orgenetic interaction with another regulator acting atthispromoter, e.g.,
byrepressing and/or directly competing forbinding with arepressor that acts here).
The example presented here ofregulation ofsdaC bytheuncharacterized TFYieP high-
lights thebroad potential forusing IPOD-HR torapidly identify and characterize previously
cryptic regulatory connections. IPOD-HR thus complements themultitude ofother
approaches noted above (based on,e.g., promoter libraries orcomputational inference) and
provides theunique benefit ofdirectly assessing binding toDNA invivo, atnative loci, under
physiological conditions ofinterest.
The utility ofIPOD-HR inidentifying theactivity ofpreviously uncharacterized TFs moti-
vates itsextension toagenome-wide scale, providing aninvivo complement tohigh-through-
putinvitro screening methods such asgenomic SELEX [6].Byapplying peak calling toour
IPOD-HR data setsacross the6conditions considered inthepresent study, wewere able to
identify thousands oflikely TFBSs, many ofwhich arenotidentifiable based onexisting data-
bases. Acomprehensive listing ofpeak calls across conditions and thresholds isgiven inS2
Data. Tocompare thepeak setsidentified from IPOD-HR data with ourexisting state of
knowledge, wedivided thepeak calls obtained from IPOD-HR into asetofannotated TFBSs
from RegulonDB and asetofbinding sites predicted using allknown PWMs available inthe
SwissRegulon database (see Methods fordetails). Wefind that across arange ofthresholds,
approximately halfofthebinding sites identified byIPOD-HR overlap with either known or
predicted sites, whereas theother halfrepresent novel binding sites which likely (asinthecase
oftheYieP sitedescribed above) reflect theactivity ofpoorly annotated ororphan TFs. Pooling
thenewly identified binding sites across conditions, ourIPOD-HR data setsareable toprovide
atotal of14,271 putative TFBSs, representing 5,090 unique sites, which areoccupied invivo
under atleast 1condition; wealso track thedynamics ofoccupancy ofthose sites across condi-
tions. This extensive map ofchromosomal occupancy and itsdynamics provide thecommu-
nity with awealth ofknown and putative novel regulatory interactions that canbefurther
explored and validated byfollow-up experiments such asthose shown inFig4.Itisalso possi-
bletocross-reference thenewly identified binding sites with high-throughput studies ofpoten-
tialbinding locations fornewly characterized TFs (e.g., ChIP orgenomic SELEX data) to
identify potential factors binding toaregion ofinterest and tousetheIPOD-HR occupancy
maps toobtain initial estimates ofthecondition-dependent occupancy ofanyidentified sites.
Global denovo discovery ofsequence specificity motifs foractive
transcription factors
While thepeak calls obtained from IPOD-HR data show strong enrichments with known
TFBSs (S1Fig), many ofthecalled peaks donotmatch anyknown orpredicted TFBSs (as
detailed inFig5A) and likely correspond either tounknown sites forwell-characterized TFs
orbinding sites forpreviously uncharacterized TFs. Given that themajority ofthenewly
inferred binding sites appear nottocorrespond toknown orpredicted sites forannotated TFs,
wehypothesized that theregulons corresponding tothose motifs would likely show enrich-
ments forpoorly annotated genes, asweexpect here toreveal theregulatory logic driving typi-
cally understudied pathways. Wethus identified likely regulatory targets ofeach newly called
peak, divided them between poorly annotated genes (those with UniProt annotation scores of
1or2outof5[34]) and well-annotated genes, and then examined theproportion ofpoorly
annotated targets foroccupancy peaks matching RegulonDB binding sites compared with all

ingsites arestrongly enriched upstream ofpoorly annotated genes, whereas those matching
annotated binding sites areenriched forwell-annotated genes. Thus, examination ofoccu-
pancy peaks derived from IPOD-HR enables identification ofalarge number ofnew putative
regulatory sites, with aparticular abundance ofpossible regulators ofpoorly annotated genes.
Our large-scale identification ofnew TFBSs also raises theimportant possibility that new
TFbinding motifs might likewise beidentifiable through denovo computational motif discov-
eryinthesetofallsequences within IPOD-HR peaks. Indeed, theapplication oftheFIRE [35]
motif discovery algorithm topeak locations obtained from IPOD-HR data reveals hundreds of
denovo discovered sequence motifs that areinformative ofstrong occupancy sites, even after
pruning ofredundant motifs (Fig 5C). Upon cross-referencing with adatabase ofknownE.
coliTFBS motifs using TOMTOM [36], wefind that approximately 25% ofthediscovered
motifs canbematched with known motifs (notably, 86/97 oftheannotated motifs intheE.coli

thenovel motifs (i.e., motifs that didnothave detectable similarity toanymotifs intheSwiss-
Regulon database) inagenome-wide search forpotential binding sites using FIMO, wefind
that 84.8% ofallIPOD occupancy peaks atapeak calling threshold of4canbeexplained by
binding sites forthenovel motifs, compared with 7.5% that canbeexplained byannotated
binding sites from RegulonDB (predicted binding sites forallnewly inferred motifs from the
IPOD-HR data areenumerated inS4Data). Thus, thenewly inferred motifs provide asub-
stantially expanded ability toassign theobserved profile ofprotein binding across the
chromosome.
InFig5E,weshow 2representative examples ofdiscovered motifs that show strong
matches with annotated motifs, demonstrating that themotifs forwell-characterized transcrip-
tional regulators such asCRP and NanR canbeinferred directly from IPOD-HR data. For
comparison, inFig5F,weshow 2newly inferred motifs that donotmatch anyknown motifs
intheE.coliSwissRegulon database. Intriguingly, thepattern ofbinding sites across theE.coli
chromosome forboth ofthese novel motifs illustrates apotential regulatory function, with the
first motif associating with asubstantial fraction ofthegenes involved inimport and metabo-
lism oflowpreference carbohydrates and thesecond apparently involved iniron acquisition
and regulation ofprotein catabolism. Inorder toprovide additional insight into thepotential
physiological roles ofthefactors binding these motifs, weconsidered thesimilarity oftheir
putative regulons tothose ofwell-characterized TFs, making useoftheJaccard index compar-
ingthegene setspotentially regulated byeach motif with those ofknown TFs. Forthetop
motif shown inFig5F,thebest match isforCRP, with aJaccard index of0.19. This finding is
consistent with theputative role inregulating carbon source utilization, although theregulon
ofthenew motif isclearly distinct from those ofanywell-characterized factor given that the
highest Jaccard index observed foritwas0.19, and thenext highest hitafter CRP was0.12.
Applying thesame analysis tothebottom motif shown inFig5Fshows that thestrongest
detectable similarity inregulons istothose ofH-NS (0.12) and Fur(0.11). These matches indi-
cate potential roles forthenew motif incoordinating responses tochanges iniron starvation
and other stress conditions such aschanging temperatures, butagain, theregulon ofthenewly
identified motif isclearly quite distinct from that ofthecharacterized TF.Inorder tofacilitate
similar analysis ofthepotential functions oftheother newly inferred motifs, weprovide inS5
Data theJaccard indices forallsignificant overlaps between theputative regulons ofournewly
inferred motifs and those ofexisting factors asannotated inRegulonDB (see caption for
details). Inaddition, weprovide anextended discussion oftheoverlaps between known TFBSs
and predicted binding sites forthenew motifs inS2Text.
Wefurther assessed theregulatory capacity ofallnewly called sequence motifs bycompar-
ingtheir genome-wide distribution ofbinding sites with annotated genes (coding regions) and
promoters. Wewould expect that binding sites forfunctional transcriptional regulators would
beenriched within promoters and depleted from coding regions, aswasthecase foroverall
IPOD-HR occupancy (Fig 2E). Indeed, theoverlap distributions ofbinding sites forournewly
inferred motifs areuniformly enriched forannotated promoters and depleted foropen reading
frame (ORFs; Fig5G;p=1.0�10−27,Wilcoxon rank sum test), demonstrating that motifs
inferred directly from IPOD-HR occupancy data occur primarily inlikely regulatory regions.
Equivalent results were obtained even after excluding allofthenewly inferred motifs with
identifiable similarity toSwissRegulon motifs (p=2.42�10−19,Wilcoxon rank sum test). To
further investigate theglobal regulatory potential ofthenewly inferred motifs, weapplied

foragiven motif (within 100bpofanannotated transcription start siteinRegulonDB) and the
corresponding gene ontology (GO) terms ofgenes inthepotentially regulated operons. We
found that outofatotal of1,732 motifs with identifiable binding sites, 1,611 have significant
mutual information with genes from atleast 1GOterm (notably including 163outofthe176
nonredundant motifs that hadidentifiable binding sites byourcriteria, and nodetectable simi-
larity topreviously known motifs). These findings highlight potential pathways that may be
regulatory targets ofthese newly inferred motifs; theresulting predicted regulatory targets are
summarized inS6Data. Inthefuture, tracking oftheoccupancy ofthese motifs over abroader
range ofphysiological conditions would yield additional insight into thelikely stimuli sensed
bythem and thedownstream processes that they may regulate (and might allow merging of
some ofthenewly inferred motifs that infactrepresent different sequences bound bythesame
factor).
Given that themajority ofthenewly inferred motifs appear nottocorrespond toannotated
TFs, and ourfindings above regarding theenrichment ofpoorly annotated genes downstream
oforphan binding peaks, wehypothesized that theregulons corresponding toournewly
inferred motifs would likely show enrichments forpoorly annotated genes, asweexpect here
toreveal theregulatory logic driving typically understudied pathways. Wethus calculated the
fractions ofthehypothetical regulons ofeach newly inferred motif that consist ofpoorly anno-
tated genes (defined asnoted above). Asshown inFig5H, wefound that theregulons ofthe
newly inferred motifs were significantly enriched forpoorly annotated genes when compared
with both theannotated E.colitranscriptional regulatory network inRegulonDB (p=6.26�
10−10,Wilcoxon signed rank test) and theoverall average rate ofpoorly annotated genes
throughout thechromosome (p=3.49�10−5,Wilcoxon signed rank test). Pairwise compari-
sonoftherate ofpoorly annotated genes between theregulon ofeach newly inferred motif
and allgenes that were notmembers ofthecorresponding regulon likewise showed asignifi-
cant enrichment forpoorly annotated genes (p=9.78�10−6,Wilcoxon signed rank test).
Taken together, weseethat IPOD-HR enables inference ofalarge number ofsequence motifs,
many ofwhich likely correspond tofunctional, butcurrently understudied, transcriptional
regulators inE.coli, providing asubstantial resource forongoing investigation ofthistran-
scriptional regulatory network.
Extended protein occupancy domains define distinct and largely stable
transcriptionally silent regions with unique sequence features
One ofthemost striking findings enabled bytheoriginal application ofIPOD wasthediscov-
eryofEPODs: large regions oftheE.colichromosome that show unusually dense levels ofpro-
tein occupancy over kilobase orlonger scales [10]. EPODs arealso clearly apparent inallour
IPOD-HR data setsand appear tocorrespond functionally tothetranscriptionally silent
extended protein occupancy domains (tsEPODs) ofVora and colleagues [10]. The profile of

dependent occupancy ofthese chromosomal structures.
The identified EPODs show remarkable stability (Fig 6B), with approximately 200EPODs
ineach physiological condition (orapproximately 450using arelaxed calling threshold; see
Methods fordetails) and similar fractions ofthegenome contained inEPODs ineach case. A
comprehensive listing ofEPODs identified across ourconditions isgiven inS7Data. The
ΔargR strain serves asanoutlier among thegenetic perturbations, with modestly decreased
(but stillsubstantial) EPOD coverage, possibly duetodecreased expression ofH-NS inthis
condition (RNA polymerase occupancy ofthehnspromoter measured inourChIP data setis
2-fold lower than inWT cells under equivalent conditions; itisunclear whether thisreflects a
regulatory ormetabolic effect caused bylossofArgR). The differing behavior ofthe ΔargR
strain appears milder using therelaxed EPOD calling threshold, and thus thedifference isat
least partially justathresholding effect (Fig 6B). The locations ofindividual EPODs arelike-
wise well maintained, even across very different physiological conditions. Forexample, inFig
6C,weshow IPOD-HR occupancy across thesame region asshown inFig6A,comparing
exponential growth inrich versus minimal media and stationary phase cells. Incontrast with
thecondition-dependent occupancy ofindividual TFs, attheapproximately kilobase scale, the
occupancy traces arenearly superimposable and show that most EPODs called under thevari-
ousconditions overlap. Furthermore, outofthesubset ofEPOD calls that arepresent inthe
“WT,rich” condition butabsent intheothers, allarepresent inthe“WT,minimal” condition
using therelaxed EPOD calling threshold, and allbuttwoalso present inthestationary phase
condition using that threshold, suggesting that many ofthesmall differences inEPOD loca-
tions that doappear between EPOD calls under different physiological conditions areinfact
duetothresholding effects. Weobserve thesame trends genome-wide: excluding the ΔargR
case, 71% to86% ofgenomic locations (atthebase pair level) that arecalled asEPODs under
anyonecondition arelikewise EPOD calls under anyother condition (Fig 6D), and atleast
78% (and typically much more) oftheEPODs called inonecondition arecontained within the
relaxed threshold calls under anyother condition (n.b. the“relaxed” threshold used here corre-
sponds totheoriginal EPOD definition from [10]). Itisalso worth noting, inthiscontext, that
89% ofthetsEPOD-occupied locations from [10] arecontained inthenew “WT,rich” relaxed
threshold EPOD set,inlinewith theobserved concordance across experimental conditions in
ournew data sets.
Several defining characteristics ofEPODs arereadily apparent upon cross-referencing with
other genome-wide data sets(Fig 6E): They represent regions ofhigh ATcontent, which are
both associated with lowlevels ofnative transcripts and decreased transcriptional propensity
(i.e., expression ofstandardized integrated reporters [38]). Consistent with ouroriginal find-
ings [10], EPODs also show high occupancy ofH-NS, HU, and LRP; lowoccupancy ofFis;andFig6.EPODs define stable genomic structures and areassocia tedwith many distinct features. (A)EPOD calls from arepresentati vegenomic region inthe

PLOS Biology |https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.pb io.3001306 June 25,2021 20/42areassociated with high efficiency ofTn5 integration (Fig 6E). While thelatter might seem
surprising given that highly protein occupied regions oneukaryotic chromatin tend toexclude
Tn5 (asisused togreat effect inassay fortransposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing
[ATAC-seq] experiments [39]), wenote that bacterial H-NS occupancy haspreviously been
shown tofacilitate Tn5 activity [40]. Additional characteristics ofEPODs, such asreduced
densities ofpossible Dam methylation sites (consistent with theexpected blocking ofDam
methylase bybound proteins, previously shown ininvivo methylase protection experiments
[41]) and acharacteristic pattern ofDNA structural parameters including decreased minor
groove width, areshown inS4Table.
The remarkable condition invariance ofthelocations ofEPODs outlined above, even across
such dramatic changes astransition from exponential tostationary phase, suggests that
EPODs predominantly represent fixed structural features oftheE.colichromosome, rather
than highly dynamic regulatory structures. Wethus examined theclasses ofgenes (assessed
using GOterms) most strongly enriched ordepleted inEPODs. Asillustrated inFig7A,
EPODs show strong enrichments formobile elements (GO:0006313) and prophage genes (spe-
cifically lytic pathways; GO:0019835) and aredepleted forcore metabolic pathways such as
ribosome components (GO:0005840). Indeed, EPODs areassociated with thesilencing of
many prophages (e.g., Fig7B)and even smaller operons ofunknown function (e.g., Fig7C).
Our findings regarding EPODs, particularly thehigh levels ofH-NS binding inEPODs and
theknown role ofH-NS asaxenogeneic silencer [42,43], arehighly consistent with prior infor-
mation regarding thesilencing role ofH-NS. Inorder todetermine theextent towhich H-NS
silenced regions and EPODs asdefined here overlap, wecompared thedistribution ofEPODs
across thegenome with H-NS ChIP-seq data from [44]. Using anunsupervised clustering
method todivide genomic intervals into high, medium, and lowlevels ofH-NS occupancy, we
found that 72.4% ofEPODs fallinto thehigh H-NS category, compared with 5.4% ofnon-
EPOD regions (S3Fig, panel A).Nevertheless, when considering theaverage transcript levels
observed asarising from thesame genomic intervals, theEPODs from thelowH-NS and
medium H-NS categories stillshowed significantly lower expression than non-EPOD regions
with similar H-NS levels (S3Fig, panel B),and thesmall number ofhighly H-NS bound
regions that arenotpart ofEPODs areinfactmore silent than highly H-NS bound EPODs.
Taken together, wethus observe that while many EPODs represent chromosomal regions
silenced byH-NS, roughly one-third toone-fourth ofEPODs donotshow thecharacteristics
ofhighly H-NS occupied regions, butarenevertheless transcriptionally silenced byan
extended stretch ofhigh protein occupancy. The possibility ofcourse exists that H-NS isrepo-
sitioned intheconditions ofourstudy, which differ from those of[44], tocover theremainder
oftheEPODs identified here. The mechanism ofsilencing atthese non-H-NS dependent
EPODs willlikely beafruitful area forfuture investigation.
Discussion
The study ofbacterial transcriptional regulatory networks haslong benefitted from bottom-up
approaches such asDNase footprinting, ChIP-chip, and ChIP-seq tomap thebehavior ofindi-
vidual factors and regulons. Atthesame time, however, theinsight provided bysuch
approaches hasbeen inherently limited bytheneed tospecify apriori thetarget ofinvestiga-
tion, either interms oftheregulator, regulated gene, orboth. However, aswehope tohave
demonstrated here, aglobal agnostic strategy (asexemplified byIPOD-HR) provides aunique
top-down complement toexisting methods bypermitting rapid profiling oftheprotein occu-
pancy landscape ofabacterial chromosome. Wehave demonstrated that IPOD-HR simulta-
neously enables resolution ofindividual changes inTFbinding atspecific sites, inference of

tional regulators, and large-scale patterns ofprotein occupancy indicative ofconstitutively
silenced genomic regions. IPOD-HR thus falls into thesame family asmethods such asDNase
Ihypersensitivity [45], micrococcal nuclease digestion with deep sequencing (MNase-seq)
[46], and ATAC-seq [39], butwasfrom itsinception developed, tuned, and validated forthe
unique molecular and biophysical features ofbacterial chromosomes (wenote that applica-
tions ofATAC-like methods tobacteria have recently been reported inpreprints [47,48] post-
dating theoriginal preprint ofthepresent manuscript [49]).
Weexpect that all3keycapabilities ofIPOD-HR highlighted above willprove tobeofsub-
stantial utility ininvestigating allcultivable bacterial transcriptional regulatory networks and
could potentially even beapplied toenvironmental samples tostudy occupancy landscapes in
uncultivable bacteria. The ability todirectly track theoccupancy ofTFBSs foralarge setof
transcriptional regulators inparallel provides themissing link that haspreviously stymied
efforts topredict thetranscriptional output ofE.coliacross conditions, asconsideration of
only theexpression levels ofTFs topredict thebehavior oftheir regulons hasyielded mixed
results [8,50]. Furthermore, theability toidentify likely regulatory sites even intheabsence of
prior knowledge, asshown both forisolated promoters (Fig 4)and inference ofentire regulons
(Fig 5),willsubstantially accelerate ourability tocomplete awiring diagram fortheE.coli
transcriptional regulatory network and torapidly approach thenetworks ofother lesswell-
characterized bacterial species. Inthelatter case, weexpect that theability ofIPOD-HR to
highlight thelocations ofTFBSs, and thedemonstrated feasibility ofinferring DNA-binding
protein sequence motifs based onthose sites, willallow therapid identification ofsites ofinter-
estfordetailed follow-up studies (e.g., application ofpulldowns similar tothose inFig4to
identify theprecise factor(s) occupying aparticular motif). The resulting information willpro-
vide anessential setofbuilding blocks toaidintheoverall reconstruction ofatranscriptional
regulatory network. Inaddition, tracking oftheoccupancy ofdifferent motifs across condi-
tions willlikely assist intheidentification ofbiological conditions pertinent tothefunction of
thefactor binding each motif, and cross-referencing with RNA polymerase occupancy will
provide evidence onthesign ofregulatory output associated with each site. IPOD-HR thus
provides apowerful high-throughput invivo approach tracking occupancy atnative sites,
complementing methods based onscreening with purified proteins [29], computational infer-
ence [31], orreporter assays [30].
Our study ofdiverse experimental conditions across different genetic and physiological
states provides acomprehensive view oftheprotein–DNA interactome ofE.coli. Aswehave
shown, themajority ofdiscovered occupancy events donotcorrespond topreviously known
orannotated sites ofprotein–DNA interactions. Wehave further shown that these global
occupancy profiles canbeused forwholesale discovery ofsequence specificity forthesetof
TFs active under these conditions. These occupancy maps and thecorresponding DNA motifs
provide thecommunity with arich catalog oflikely regulatory events tostudy, targeting either
particular genes orlarger pathways. Indeed, ourfinding that thenovel occupancy sites andFig7.EPODs arestatistica llyenriched forgenes inspecific functional categories. (A)The genome wassplit into

and expand thephysiological and regulatory modules ofE.coli.
Our study also provides significant additional evidence forthepresence oflarge, transcrip-
tionally silent, high-occupancy chromosomal domains inE.coli, termed “EPODs.” Many such
EPODs clearly correspond toregions ofH-NS binding, which haspreviously been shown to
form several types offilaments that silence horizontally acquired DNA [5,43,51–53]. Onthe
other hand, wealso observe asubstantial fraction ofEPODs that donotcorrespond toH-NS
binding and yetarestillassociated with transcriptionally silent regions ofthechromosome.
Numerous questions regarding thenature and role ofthose EPODs remain forfuture work,
including thefollowing: What istheprotein composition ofnon-H-NS EPODs? What rules
dictate their formation onspecific sites? Wearealso tempted tospeculate that, insome con-
texts, non-H-NS EPODs may undergo condition-dependent changes inoccupancy that drive
transcriptional regulation, although nosuch cases could bedefinitively identified inthecondi-
tions studied here. Such behavior hasalready been observed forH-NS filaments invarious
enterobacteria [54,55]. Ongoing application ofIPOD-HR toabroader range ofphysiological
conditions inE.coliwillprovide further insight into theoverall landscape oflarge-scale protein
occupancy across conditions, allowing tracking both ofoccupancy associated with H-NS (and
therelated protein StpA) and other classes ofEPODs inasingle experiment.
Our IPOD-HR strategy formapping theglobal dynamics oftheE.coliprotein–DNA inter-
actome relies only onsimple physicochemical principles forisolating protein–DNA com-
plexes. Assuch, itiseasily transferable toother bacterial species. The rich and comprehensive
data setsthat would result, and application ofstatistical inference during data processing as
exemplified here, willprovide important regulatory roadmaps inorganisms with lesswell-
studied transcriptional regulatory networks, such asnon-model bacterial species ofclinical
and industrial importance. Inthefuture, applications toabroader range ofphysiological con-
ditions (inE.coli) and toother bacterial strains and species willprovide important information
ontherole oflarge-scale nucleoprotein assemblies ongene regulation and pave theway for
more comprehensive and predictive models oftranscriptional regulatory logic.
Methods
Strain construction
The base strain forallexperiments used here isanMG1655 stock obtained from theTavazoie
Lab(Columbia University, New York, NY), which belongs tothesubstrain typified byATCC
700926 [56]. Allspecified gene knockouts were obtained byP1transduction [57] oftheFRT-
flankedkanR marker from thecorresponding knockout strain oftheKeio collection [58], fol-
lowed byFlprecombinase mediated excision ofthemarker using thepCP20 plasmid [59] to
leave asmall scar inplace oftheoriginal ORF. Candidate isolates foreach deletion were grown
overnight at42˚C todrop thepCP20 plasmid and then replica plated onto appropriate selec-
tiveplates toensure lossofboth theplasmid and kanamycin resistance marker. Knockouts
were confirmed byPCR fragment sizing and/or sequencing across themarker scar. Note that
the ΔlexA strain that werefer toisinfact ΔlexA/ΔsulA, aslossoflexA islethal inthepresence
ofafunctional sulA gene [60,61].
Forconstruction ofthelacZ reporter strains fortheexperiments shown inFig4E,thelacZ
gene from ourMG1655 background strain wasfirst removed byP1transduction ofachloram-
phenicol resistance gene, yielding MG1655 lacZ::cml. Anadditional copy ofthisstrain was
constructed bytransduction oftheKeio collection yieP::kan gene and subsequent marker exci-
sion (asabove) toyield MG1655 lacZ::cml yieP::scar. Wethen generated plasmid-born copies
ofareporter gene inwhich thelacZ ORF wasplaced directly after thesdaC promoter ofE.coli

promoter variants inwhich either orboth oftheidentified putative YieP binding sites inthe
promoter were perturbed, with Site1“catttcATTTGTTATATGAAT gtttctt” to“catttcATAAC
TTATATGTTAgtttctt” containing amutation and Site2containing a“cagttaATATGTCATA

ized region istheputative YieP site; Site2corresponds tositehighlighted incyan inFig4D,
with Site1thesitefurther upstream ofitrelative tosdaC). All4promoter variants were gener-
ated byGibson assembly [62] using theNEB Hifi Builder Master Mix (New England Biolabs,
Ipswich, MA) onaplasmid next toanFRT-flanked kanamycin resistance marker, cloned into
DH5α cells, and validated bySanger sequencing ofthepromoter and adjacent plasmid regions.
The promoter-lacZ constructs were then each integrated into aWT MG1655 strain replacing
thearaC-araBAD locus via λredrecombination ofadsDNA PCR product produced using NEB
Q5polymerase (using pKD46 asahelper plasmid asabove), selected onMacConkey/arabinose
+kanamycin plates, and transduced into theMG1655 lacZ::cml and MG1655 lacZ::cml yieP::
scar strains. The kanamycin resistance marker wasremoved following thestandard
pCP20-based marker excision protocol asabove, and thefinal 8strains (allpairwise combina-
tions of4promoter variants andyieP+/−) were validated byPCR fragment sizing oftheyieP
andaralociand Sanger sequencing ofthesdaC promoter attheara::sdaCp-lacZ locus.
Media/culture conditions
Forroutine cloning applications and forrecovery ofcryogenically preserved cells, weused LB
(Lennox) media (10g/Ltryptone, 5g/Lyeast extract, and 5g/LNaCl), with bacteriological
agar (15g/L) added asappropriate.
Forphysiological experiments, wemade useofavariety ofsupplemented versions ofM9
defined medium (6g/LNa2HPO 4,3g/LKH 2PO 4,1g/LNH 4Cl,0.5g/LNaCl, 1mM MgSO 4)
[56]. Our M9minimal media condition (M9/min) additionally includes 0.2% (w/v) glucose,
0.4mM CaCl 2,40μMferric citrate, and themicronutrient mixture typically incorporated in
MOPS minimal media [63]. Our M9RDM condition (M9/rdm) instead incorporates into the
M9base 0.4% (w/v) glucose, MOPS micronutrients (asabove), 4μMCaCl 2,40μMferric cit-
rate, and 1xsupplements ACGU and EZasused inMOPS RDM [63].
Cell growth and harvest forIPOD-HR
The cells ofinterest were grown overnight inthemedia ofinterest after inoculation from an
LBplate. Inthemorning, theculture wasback-diluted into fresh, prewarmed media toan
OD600 of0.003. The culture wasthen grown tothetarget OD600 (0.2, except inthecase ofsta-
tionary phase samples, which aredescribed below), atwhich point a200-μL aliquot was
removed and preserved in1mLofDNA/RNA Shield (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA) following
themanufacturer’s instructions.
The remainder oftheculture wastreated with rifampin toafinal concentration of150μg/
mLand incubated for10minutes under thesame culture conditions asthemain growth to
immobilize initiating RNA polymerase atactive promoters and permit completion oftran-
scripts inprogress. The culture wasthen rapidly mixed with concentrated formaldehyde/
sodium phosphate (pH 7.4) buffer sufficient toyield afinal concentration of10mM NaPO 4
and 1%v/vformaldehyde. Cross-linking wasallowed toproceed for5minutes atroom tem-
perature with vigorous shaking, followed byquenching with anexcess ofglycine (final concen-
tration 0.333 M)for5minutes with shaking atroom temperature. The cross-linked cells were
subsequently chilled oniceand washed twice with ice-cold phosphate buffered saline, 10mL

and then thepellets were snap-frozen inadryice-ethanol bath and stored at-80C.
Inthecase ofourstationary phase samples, cells were grown asdescribed above interms of
back-dilution and growth toanOD600 of0.2,and then grown foranadditional 3hours prior
toRNA harvest, rifampin treatment, and cross-linked asdescribed above.
Cell lysis and DNA preparation
Frozen cellpellets were resuspended in1xIPOD lysis buffer (10mM Tris HCl, pH8.0;50mM
NaCl) containing 1xprotease inhibitors (Roche Complete Mini, EDTA free, Roche Diagnos-
ticsGmbH, Mannheim, Germany) and 52.5 kU/mL ofready-lyse (Epicentre, Madison, WI):
600μLperpellet (stationary phase cells were diluted 10× prior tolysis, and only 1/10 ofthe
resulting material used, duetothemuch higher biomass ofthose pellets). Weincubated the
resuspended pellet for15minutes at30˚C and then placed itonice.Wethen sonicated the
cells using aBranson digital sonicator at25% power, using three 10-second bursts with 10-sec-
ond pauses between bursts. The cells were maintained inaweticebath throughout sonication.
Wethen performed acalibrated DNA digestion tosub-200-bp fragments, byadding tothe
sonicated lysates 60μgRNase A(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), 6μLDNase I
(Fisher product #89835), 5.4μL100mM MnCl2, and 4.5μL100mM CaCl2, and then incubat-
ingonice.While theappropriate digestion time must becalibrated foreach particular sample
type and batch ofDNase, 30minutes ofdigestion proved appropriate forallsamples here.
Reactions were quenched after completion bytheaddition of50μL500mM EDTA (pH 8.0),
typically yielding 50-to200-bp fragments.
IPOD-HR interface extraction
Prior tointerface extraction, samples were clarified bycentrifugation for10minutes at
169,000 xgat4C.After clarification, a50microliter input sample wasdiluted 1:9inelution
buffer (50mM Tris, pH8.0;10mM EDTA; 1%SDS) and kept oniceuntil thereverse cross-
linking step. The remainder ofthelysate wasmixed with 1volume of100mM Tris base and 2
volumes of25:24:1 phenol:chloroform :isoamyl alcohol, vortexed, and then incubated for10
minutes atroom temperature. After incubation, thesample wasspun at21,130 xgfor2min-
utes atroom temperature, allowing formation ofawhite disc attheaqueous–organic interface
enriched forprotein–DNA complexes [10,11].
The complete aqueous phases were removed and discarded, and theremaining disc washed
again with 350microliters TE(10mM Tris, pH8.0;1mM EDTA), 350microliters 100mM
Tris base, and 700microliters 24:1 chloroform:isoamyl alcohol. The resulting mixture wasvor-
texed vigorously and again centrifuged for2minutes at21,130 xg.Allliquid wasagain
removed, and thewash wasrepeated using 700microliters TEand 700microliters 24:1 chloro-
form:isoamyl alcohol. After vortexing, centrifugation, and removal ofthefinal wash (exactly as
above), anyresidual liquid wasremoved bywicking with alaboratory wipe (ifanysubstantial
pools ofliquid were present). Finally, theinterface wasresuspended in500microliters ofelu-
tion buffer (described above), vortexed vigorously, and kept oniceuntil reverse cross-linking
(nomore than afewhours).

point theinterface willadhere tothetube wall and allow easy removal oftheaqueous layer.
Wehave also found that thehandling characteristics oftheinterface vary greatly with theplas-
ticware inuse. Forthework described here, wehave used 2-mL microcentrifuge tubes from

wall (other plasticware may yield variable results); atthesame time, theuseoflow-retention
pipette tipsappears toreduce binding oftheinterface tothetip.
RNA polymerase chromatin immunoprecip itation
DNA forRNA polymerase ChIP-seq experiments wasprepared asdescribed above for
IPOD-HR interface extraction upthrough thelysate clarification stage. Whenever possible, we
used frozen pellets obtained from thesame culture formatched IPOD-HR and ChIP-seq
experiments, inwhich case thelysates were pooled and mixed immediately prior toremoval of
asingle input sample. ChIP procedures here were modeled onthose of[64].
The digested lysates were mixed 1:1with 2xIPbuffer (200 mM Tris, pH8.0;600mM NaCl;
4%Triton X-100; 2xRoche Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitors) and then kept onicefor
nomore than afewhours prior toantibody addition. Weadded 10microliters ofpurified
anti-E.coliRNA polymerase antibody (NeoClone WP023, NeoClone, Madison, WI) and incu-
bated overnight with rocking at4˚C. Near theend oftheincubation period, weresuspended
analiquot of50microliters ofprotein Gdynabeads (Invitrogen, subsidiary ofThermo Fisher
Scientific, Waltham, MA) and equilibrated theprotein Gbeads with 1xIPbuffer lacking prote-
aseinhibitors. The bead aliquot wasadded totheantibody-lysate mixture and then incubated
2hours with rocking at4˚C. The bead–antibody–target complexes were subsequently sub-
jected tothefollowing series ofwashes, with 1mLused perwash. Allwashes were atroom
temperature and involved manual resuspension ofthebeads inthenew wash buffer followed
byimmediate re-separation:
•1xWash buffer A(100 mM Tris, pH8.0;250mM LiCl; 2%Triton X-100; 1mM EDTA)
•1xWash buffer B(100 mM Tris, pH8.0;500mM NaCl; 1%Triton X-100; 0.1% sodium
deoxycholate; 1mM EDTA)
•1xWash buffer C(10mM Tris, pH8.0;500mM NaCl; 1%Triton X-100; 1mM EDTA)
•1xTE(10mM Tris, pH8.0;1mM EDTA).
The antigens were subsequently eluted byadding 500microliters ofelution buffer (compo-
sition described above) and incubating 30minutes at65˚C, with vigorous vortexing every 5to
10minutes.
Cross-linking reversal and recovery ofDNA
The DNA from theinput, IPOD-HR, and ChIP fractions described above wasrecovered using
identical procedures: Samples diluted inelution buffer (see above) were incubated overnight
(6to16hours) at65˚C toreverse formaldehyde cross-links. After allowing thesamples tocool
toroom temperature, wethen added 100μgofRNase A(Thermo Fisher Scientific), incubated
2hours at37˚C, then added 200μgofproteinase K(Fermentas, subsidiary ofThermo Fisher
Scientific, Waltham, MA) and incubated anadditional 2hours at50˚C. DNA wasthen recov-
ered viastandard phenol–chlorofor mextraction and ethanol precipitation, following protocols
from [57]. Weused Glycoblue (Ambion, subsidiary ofThermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham,
MA) asacoprecipitant, NaCl asaprecipitating salt(due tothepresence ofSDS inoursolu-
tion), and washed with ice-cold 95% ethanol toavoid lossoflowmolecular weight DNA.
Recovered DNA wasquantified viafluorescent quantitation (using either theInvitrogen
PicoGreen orPromega (Madison, WI) QuantIT system), and samples ofsufficiently high con-
centration were also runona2%agarose gelforfragment sizeassessment. Typical total yields

ngfortheIPOD-HR samples, and 1to10ngfortheChIP samples.
Preparation ofnext-generation sequencing (NGS) libraries
Except asotherwise noted, allDNA samples were prepared forIllumina sequencing using the
NEBNext Ultra DNA Library Prep Kit(NEB product #E7370), with either single index ordual
index primers also obtained from NEB. Wefollowed themanufacturer’s instructions except
forthefollowing variations:
•Cleanups prior tothePCR step were performed using aZymo Clean&Concentrator 5spin
column kitorZymo Oligo Clean&Concentrator spin column kitinstead ofAmpure beads,
inorder toavoid thelossoflowmolecular weight DNA.
•Weused Ampure and Axygen PCR cleanup beads interchangeably. The final cleanup step
wasinsome cases repeated toremove obvious populations ofadapter dimers.
Alllibraries were sequenced oneither anIllumina HiSeq orNextSeq instrument; detailed
statistics onread lengths and counts areprovided inS5Table. Asmall number ofsamples
were prepared forsequencing using anIllumina Truseq Nano kitor(inthecase ofonebiologi-
calreplicate) aTruseq kitinstead oftheNEBnext kitnoted above (those samples areidentified
inS5Table); wefound that upon calculation ofcorrelations between thecoverages ofabroad
range ofIPOD, input, and RNA polymerase, ChIP-seq samples prepared using various
sequencing preparation kitsthat theTruseq Nano samples were indistinguishable from NEB-
Next Ultra samples upon clustering oftheoccupancy profiles across sample types and condi-
tions. Toavoid anypossibility ofbias from thesingle included Truseq replicate (which wasfor
the ΔlexA genotype), weobserved qualitatively equivalent results inTFBS occupancy dynamics
(Fig 3A) iftheTruseq replicate wasremoved from analysis (notably, therank ordering of
LexA occupancy across samples waspreserved, and ofthe6conditions considered, only the
stationary phase and ΔlexA conditions hadaverage occupancy −log 10pscores lessthan 2).
RNA isolation and RNA-seq sample preparation
Asnoted above, samples forRNA isolation were preserved immediately prior torifampin
addition bydilution ina5xexcess ofDNA/RNA Shield (Zymo Research); theRNA samples
were then stored at−80˚C until purification. RNA wasisolated using aZymo QuickRNA
microprep kitfollowing themanufacturer’s instructions, including theon-column DNase
digestion. Purified RNA wasquantified using RiboGreen (Invitrogen) and then ribosome-
depleted using theIllumina RiboZero Gram-negative bacteria kitaccording tothemanufac-
turer’s instructions, with theinput RNA amount and allreaction volumes cutinhalf. Final
recovery oftheribo-depleted RNA wasaccomplished using themodified Zymo spin column
protocol present intheRiboZero documentation. Ribo-depleted RNA wasthen prepared for
sequencing using theNEBNext Ultra Directional RNA kit(NEB product E7420) and
sequenced asdescribed above fortheDNA samples.
Analysis ofNGS data
AllNGS data were preprocessed using acommon pipeline, after which DNA and RNA data
setswere processed separately. The reference genome inallcases wasthemost recent version
oftheE.coliMG1655 genome (GenBank U00096.3), with gene, TFBS, and transcription start
siteannotations from RegulonDB [7].Data processing wasautomated using in-house python
and bash scripts and parallelized where possible using GNU parallel [65] orthepython

data from rawreads isavailable from https://github.com/freddolino-l ab/ipod_v1_2020; we
also have distributed aready-to-use analysis environment intheform ofasingularity con-
tainer, asdocumented intheGitHub repository noted above.
Read quality control and preprocessing. Allreads were subjected toadapter removal
using cutadapt 1.8.1 [66] tocutthecommon sequence ofIllumina Truseq adapters and then
trimmed toremove low-quality read ends with Trimmomatic 0.33 [67], using thetrimming
steps “TRAILING:3 SLIDINGWINDOW:4 :15MINLEN:10.” Samples were subjected toaddi-
tional manual quality checks using FastQC [68] and MultiQC [69] toidentify anyirregularities
interms ofsequence content, quality, orduplication.
DNA sequencing and protein occupancy calling. Surviving DNA reads were aligned to
theU00096.3 genome using bowtie2 version 2.1.0 with “very sensitive” end-to-end alignment
presets, and dovetail alignments allowed. Only concordant paired-end reads were retained for
subsequent quantitation. Read occupancies were calculated ata5-bp resolution along the
chromosome using theparsing method ofKroner and colleagues [24] and scaling thebase
pair–wise contribution ofeach read bytheinverse ofitslength (thus, each read contributed
thesame total amount ofoccupancy signal). The resulting read densities were then quantile
normalized, acting separately fortheinput, IPOD interface, and RNA polymerase ChIP-seq
tracks ofeach biological condition. Inorder toaccount forthehigher amount ofgenomic
DNA present near theorigin ofreplication relative totheterminus, wefitted asmoothing
spline with 4evenly spaced knots and periodic boundary conditions totheinput sample for
each condition; thesmoothing spline provides alow-pass filter onabundances that accounts
forlarge-scale variations inDNA abundance across thegenome. The useof4knots allows
inflection points attheorigin, terminus, and thehalfway points between them. Alloccupancy
data setswere divided bythespline-smoothed abundances ofthecorresponding input data
prior tofurther processing. After abundance normalization, alldata tracks were rescaled to
have matching means, and then allreplicates foreach sample type/biological condition combi-
nation were averaged togenerate acomposite occupancy track (yielding, forexample, 1input
data track fortheWT M9/RDM/glu condition, 1IPOD data track fortheWT M9/RDM/glu
condition, etc.).
The displayed IPOD and ChIP data tracks were then obtained aslog 2ratios oftheextracted
(interphase orChIP) toinput samples foreach condition; werefer tothese tracks asthe
“IPOD” and “ChIP” signals below. Upon viewing thecorrelation between total protein occu-
pancy and RNA polymerase occupancy, 2protein-occupied subpopulations were apparent (S4
Fig): alinear subpopulation where total protein and RNA polymerase arewell correlated and a
second subpopulation ofpositions where thetotal protein occupancy ismuch higher than
expected based ontheRNA polymerase occupancy. Weinterpret theformer setofpositions as
protein occupancy duedirectly toRNA polymerase binding and thelatter asnon-RNA poly-
merase occupancy (asschematized inFig1B). Toobtain thefully processed IPOD-HR signal
fornon-RNA polymerase occupancy, weapplied amodified linear model toestimate and then
remove thecontributions ofRNA polymerase totheobserved signal. Tothisend, webegan by
using only thetop2%ofobserved ChIP values, which arepresumed torepresent sites that are
bound entirely byRNA polymerase intheIPOD versus ChIP signal comparison (asinS4Fig).
Wethen generated thelinewith thelowest possible slope, and zero intercept, that issufficient
tokeep 95% ofthehigh-ChIP data region below it;thus, thisrepresents alinear transformation
oftheChIP signal that issufficient toremove thevast majority ofRNA polymerase occupancy.
The resulting slope oftheIPOD versus ChIP data wasthen used togenerate aprediction ofthe
IPOD contribution attributable toRNA polymerase binding ateach position based onthe
observed ChIP signal itself and that value subtracted from theIPOD signal. Nosubtraction

PLOS Biology |https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.pb io.3001306 June 25,2021 29/42wasperformed atpositions where theobserved RNA polymerase occupancy wasnegative, so
that theChIP subtraction canonly lower (not raise) occupancy. Wenote that thechoice of
slope tocompletely eliminate alloccupancy at95% ofthehigh-ChIP sites represents ahighly
conservative choice (interms ofremoving virtually alloccupancy from theIPOD signal that
could potentially beattributed toRNA polymerase). Any choice forthisparameter must neces-
sarily reflect abalance ofrisks, where lower values (close to50%, which would roughly match a
direct linear fittotheIPOD versus ChIP data points) increase theodds ofidentifying spurious
protein occupancy peaks actually attributable toRNA polymerase, and higher values (upto
100% would beconceivably justifiable) riskerasing true regulatory protein occupancy dueto
overzealous RNA polymerase occupancy removal.
Werefer totheresulting ChIP-subtracted IPOD signal astheIPOD-HR signal; foranalysis
and display, wefurther standardize thesignal bycalculating robust zscores, where therobust
z-score ziatposition iisdefined as
zi¼ðxi medianðXÞÞ=madðXÞ
foraIPOD-HR data vector X,and mad() indicates themedian absolute deviation. Inmany
cases amore useful signal forvisualization isap-value forenrichment ateach site; log 10p-val-
uesarecalculated under thenull hypothesis that thedistribution oftherobust z-scores isstan-
dard normal. Toprovide uncertainty estimates grounded inobserved levels ofbiological
variability across replicates, foreach data point, wealso constructed aninterval between the
lowest and highest values that could have been obtained forouroccupancy statistics using any
combination ofbiological replicates (potentially different replicates fortheIPOD, ChIP, and
input samples toconstruct thelargest possible range). Tocalculate theerror bars shown inFig
3A,wethen used parametric bootstrapping togenerate confidence intervals fortheparameters
ofinterest, assuming that thelog 10pscaled occupancy ofeach TFBS followed alog-normal dis-
tribution with amean oftheobserved mean and standard deviation ofonequarter therange
between thehighest and lowest replicate-wise values (thus treating therange ofthepessimistic
replicate-wise possible values asaninterval expected tocontain approximately 95% of
observed points); 95% confidence intervals fortheaverage site-wise occupancies were then cal-
culated from 1,000 bootstrap replicates.
Feature calling. Toidentify peaks intherobust z-scaled IPOD-HR data, weapplied con-
tinuous wavelet transform (CWT) peak calling [70] (asimplemented inthescipy.signal pack-
age), with arange ofwidths from 25bpto125bp(at5-bp increments, reflecting theexpected
range ofpeak sizes given thefragmentation ofourinput DNA) used togenerate theCWT
matrix, and refer topeaks based ontheminimum signal-to-noise ratio threshold atwhich they
appear aspeak calls (note that intheCWT method, arange ofwidths must bespecified aspart
ofthealgorithm and gives riseonly toasingle peak set). Toprovide quantitative measures of
theevidence fordifferent peak calls, separate peak setswere generated atseveral signal tonoise
thresholds (afulllisting canbeobserved inthesetofthresholds shown inS2Data). Each peak
callwaspadded by30bponeach side todefine thepeak region used insubsequent analysis.
Weshow theperformance ofavariety ofcalling thresholds inidentifying known TFBSs inS1
Fig, and based onthose findings, useathreshold of4forallother quantitative analysis pre-
sented here. However, peak setsatallthresholds aresupplied inS2Data. Comparisons were
made todata from RegulonDB release 9.4unless otherwise noted.
EPODs were called using anapproach similar tothat in[10]: Weidentified EPOD seed
regions asanyregion atleast 1,024 bpinlength, over which themedian ofa512-bp rolling
mean exceeded theoverallkthpercentile ofa256-bp rolling mean across theentire chromo-
some (inallcases acting ontherobust z-scored IPODHR data); weusedk=90forthemain
PLOS BIOL OGYHigh-reso lution protein occupancy maps oftheE.colichromosom e

thecase ofoverlapping seeds, only theonewith thehighest median wasretained. Seed regions
were then expanded inboth directions asfaraspossible while maintaining themedian ofthe
512-bp rolling mean signal over theentire EPOD callabove thethreshold noted above and
without crossing anylocation with a(rolling mean) robust z-score�0.Wenote that thelower
threshold (k=75)matches thethreshold used intheoriginal EPOD definitions from [10]
(albeit using arolling median instead ofmean todefine thesmoothed datasets), whereas the
more stringent threshold isintended tohighlight themost robust regions oflarge-scale protein
occupancy; both thresholds show similar properties interms ofoverlaps with gene setsand
genomic features.
Transcription factor co-clustering analysis. FortheTFoccupancy and co-clustering
data, weperformed consensus clustering (inspired by[71]). Foreach biological condition,
weassigned each TFascore given bythegeometric mean ofthesite-level occupancies
(IPOD-HR −log 10p-values) forannotated binding sites ofthat TFinthat condition (using a
minimum value of0.01 foreach site-level value); thecondition-wise average occupancies for
each TFwere then divided bythehighest average occupancy forthat TFacross allconditions,
yielding anoccupancy score ontheinterval (0,1] foreach TFcondition combination. The
occupancy profiles ofTFsacross conditions were clustered 100times using K-means clustering
ateach number ofclusters between 8and 12(inclusive); the“co-clustering frequency” κis
defined asthefraction ofthose 100trials inwhich agiven pair ofTFs were assigned tothe
same cluster. Wethen used thequantity (1-κ) asadistance measure inafinal hierarchical clus-
tering, assigning theTFs to10clusters, toprovide thecluster identities shown inFig3C.
RNA sequencing and differential expression calling. RNA-seq data setswere subjected
tothesame initial preprocessing and quality control steps asoutlined above fortheDNA sam-
ples, and then gene-level expression wasquantified using kallisto v0.43 [72] onaversion ofthe
MG1655 (GenBank NC_000913) genome with allribosomal RNAs removed. Gene-level TPM
values from kallisto were used foralldownstream analysis unless otherwise noted. Togenerate
high-resolution occupancy plots, reads were instead aligned with bowtie2 asdescribed above
forDNA reads, and read occupancies quantified using thegenomecov command ofbedtools2
[73].
TFBS comparison
Binding sites identified from IPOD-HR peaks (asdescribed above inthe“Feature calling”
paragraph) were cross-referenced with known andpredicted TFBSs using bedtools2 [73]. “Known”
sites comprise allbinding sites contained intheRegulonDB release 9.4BindingSiteSet.txt file[7];
“predicted” sites areidentified byscanning theMG1655 (GenBank NC_000913) genome with
FIMO [74] using allE.coliposition weight matrices from SwissRegulon [75] (asdistributed bythe
MEME project); each PWM wasapplied separately, andallsites with aq-value lessthan 0.2were
retained. Default settings were used forFIMO, except thatthebackground wasasecond-order
Markov model based ontheNC_000913 genome, andthenumber ofmaximum stored scores was
setto10,000,000.
Motif identification
Novel sequence motifs implied byIPOD-HR data were identified using aninference pipeline
built offofFIRE [35]. Occupancy peaks and associated discrete threshold scores inthe
IPOD-HR traces were called using theCWT-based approach described above, using ascore
threshold of4;each peak wasassigned adiscrete score corresponding totheaverage IPOD-HR
occupancy score within that peak, rounding down. Wethen generated abackground
PLOS BIOL OGYHigh-reso lution protein occupancy maps oftheE.colichromosom e
PLOS Biology |https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.pb io.3001306 June 25,2021 31/42distribution ofunbound sequences drawn from theportion ofthegenome notincluded in
peaks, matching thelength distribution ofthepeaks butwith 3times asmany locations; all
such background regions were assigned ascore of0todistinguish them from thevarious thre-
sholded peak regions.
Motifs were called using FIRE with 2separate variations: FIRE_gapped (with
parameters --kungapped=6 --gap=0–10 --jn_t_gapped=4 --minr=0.5),
which searches forgapped motifs typical ofprokaryotic TFBSs; and FIRE_maxdeg (with
parameters --jn_t=8 --minr=1.5 --maxdeg=1.8), which searches formotifs while
preserving information content above aspecified threshold. Weapplied additional empirical filters
tospecifically enrich forpeaks corresponding tobinding sites: Allpeaks identified viaFIRE were
required tohave themotif significantly depleted from thebackground population (p<0.01). To
assess theFDR ofourmethods, wealsogenerated 20decoy peak setsbyshuffling thelocations of
therealpeaks observed ineach condition, along with corresponding randomized unbound setsfor
each, andthen applied identical peak calling procedures toeach decoy set.
Toavoid repeated reporting ofvery similar motifs which might beidentified byourpipe-
lines, weapplied thematrix-clustering module ofRSAT [76] (using recommended thresholds
-lth cor 0.7 -lth w5-lth Ncor 0.4) toobtain nonredundant motif setsfor
downstream analysis. Wecompared allcalled motifs with previously known motifs from the
SwissRegulon database using TOMTOM [36] with default parameters, requiring anE-value of
0.5orlower for“Identified” hits. Fortheidentification ofpredicted regulons associated with
each motif, weapplied theFIMO program [74] toidentify potential binding sites ontheE.coli
K12 genome, with aq-value threshold of0.2;these were referred toas“strict” motif hits. For
thesubset ofpredicted motifs that yielded nopotential binding sites atthisthreshold, we
instead report alllocations that correspond totheFIMO score ofthebest single location found
inthegenome, referring tothese as“loose” motif hits. Forthepurposes ofouranalysis ofthe
potential regulatory networks ofnovel motifs), wemarked each transcriptional unit inE.coli
asbeing regulated byaparticular motif ifand only ifapredicted binding siteforthat motif
waswithin 100bpoftheannotated transcription start site(inRegulonDB) forthat transcrip-
tional unit.
Invitro pulldown ofunidentified transcription factors
Inorder toidentify theprotein(s) binding tothesdaC promoter (asinFig4),wefirst prepared
biotinylated bait DNA bycloning afragment ofthesdaC promoter (running from positions
2927790 to2927975 intheU00096.3 genome) into apAZ3-based cloning vector [77] and then
amplifying that region oftheplasmid using aprimer pair where oneprimer contained a50bio-
tinylation. The resulting 486-bp fragment wastreated with Exonuclease I(Affymetrix, subsidi-
aryofThermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) according tothemanufacturer’s instructions
toremove unreacted primer and then purified using aZymo Clean &Concentrate 25kit.
The biotinylated bait DNA wasthen bound toequilibrated Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin
C1beads (Invitrogen). Beads were equilibrated bywashing 3times with 1xB&W buffer (5
mM Tris Cl,pH7.5;0.5mM EDTA; 1MNaCl) and then resuspended in5volumes of2x
B&W buffer, using 42μLoftheoriginal resuspended bead solution perreaction. The equili-
brated beads were combined with 8μgofbiotinylated bait DNA plus anappropriate volume of
water toyield afinal 1xB&W solution and incubated 15minutes atroom temperature with
gentle rocking toallow forbait binding. The beads were then washed 3times with 500μLof1x
B&W buffer, twice in500μLof1xBMg/THS buffer (5mM HEPES, pH7.5;5mM MgCl2; 50
mM KCl; 31mM NaCl; 1xcOmplete EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Roche)), and once with
500μLof1xBMg/THS/EP buffer (1xBMg/THS buffer supplemented with 20mM EGTA (pH

200μLofBMg/THS/EP buffer and gently mixed byhand for1minute tocomplete
equilibration.
Cell extracts were prepared bygrowing toanoptical density (OD) at600nm(OD600) of
0.2inM9/RDM/glucose media (following thesame procedures asthose given forIPOD-HR
experiments). Once reaching thetarget OD, thecells were chilled 10minutes oniceand then
pelleted byspinning for10minutes at5,500 xgwhile at4˚C. Supernatant wasremoved, and
thecells were flash-frozen inadryice/ethanol bath. Cells were then lysed byresuspending the
frozen pellet resulting from 82mLofculture in160μLofB-PER IIbacterial protein extraction
reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Wethen added 3.8mLof1xBMg/THS buffer and 0.8μL
ofReadyLyse lysozyme solution (Lucigen), 40μLof10mg/mL RNase A,20μLofCaCl 2,and
200μLofmicrococcal nuclease (NEB; 2,000,000 gelunits/mL). The lysis/digestion reaction
wasallowed toproceed for30minutes atroom temperature and then clarified bycentrifuga-
tion at30minutes at16,100x gheld at4˚C. The reaction washalted bytheaddition of444μL
of5MNaCl, and then theentire volume applied toa3kDa MWCO spin filter (Amicon Ultra;
Millipore, Burlington, MA) and centrifuged at(3,200 xgheld at4˚C) until approximately
400μLofretentate remained. Wethen added 3.6mLofBMg/THS (lacking NaCl and KCl, but
containing 5mM CaCl2) and filtered to400μLofretentate. Retained liquid wasthen recov-
ered and diluted toafinal volume of4.0mLwith addition ofsalt-free BMg/THS +5mM
CaCl 2.The retained lysate wasthen incubated 30minutes atroom temperature topermit fur-
ther activity ofmicrococcal nuclease onremaining DNA inthesample and then quenched
with 168μLof500mM EGTA. The volume ofthesample wasreduced toapproximately 1.6
mLbyultrafiltration asabove and further supplemented with 10μg/mL ofpoly d(IC) and 1
mM dithiothreitol.
Probing ofthelysates wasthen accomplished bycombining theequilibrated bait-bead com-
plexes (described above) with thelysates and incubating 30minutes with rocking atroom tem-
perature. The supernatant wasthen removed, and thebeads washed twice with 200μLof
BMg/THS/20 mM EGTA/10 μg/mL poly d(IC) and once with 200μLofBMg/THS/20 mM
EGTA. Proteins were then eluted from thebeads through progressive washes ofelution buffer
(25mM Tris HCl, pH7.5) with 100mM NaCl, 200mM NaCl, 400mM NaCl, and 1MNaCl,
with 50μLused foreach elution.
Wesuccessively probed thelysates described here with probes containing promoter
sequences fromlexA,purR, and finally,sdaC (each containing identical plasmid-derived flank-
ingsequences). Anapproximately 25-kDa band ofinterest appeared inthe400mM and 1M
NaClsdaC eluates butnoteluates from aparallel experiment performed under identical condi-
tions with asegment ofthethiC promoter; these bands were excised from asilver-stained gel.
The 400mM gelslice wasthen subjected toproteomic analysis attheUniversity ofMichigan
Proteomics &Peptide Synthesis core facility. The gelslice wasprocessed using aProGest robot
(DigiLab, Holliston, MA) towash with 25mM ammonium bicarbonate followed byacetoni-
trile, reduce with 10mM dithiothreitol at60˚C followed byalkylation with 50mM iodoaceta-
mide atroom temperature, digested with trypsin (Promega) at37˚C for4hours, and then
quenched with formic acid. The digest wasthen analyzed bynano liquid chromatography with
tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with aWaters NanoAcquity HPLC system interfaced
toaThermo Fisher QExactive. Peptides were loaded onatrapping column and eluted over a
75-μm analytical column at350nL/min; both columns were packed with Jupiter Proteo resin
(Phenomenex, Torrance, CA). The injection volume was30μL.The mass spectrometer was
operated indata-dependent mode, with theOrbitrap operating at60,000 fullwidth athalf
maximum (FWHM) and 17,500 FWHM formass spectrometry (MS) and tandem mass spec-
trometry (MS/MS), respectively. The 15most abundant ions were selected forMS/MS. Data

fold software forvalidation, filtering, and tocreate anonredundant listpersample. Data were
filtered using 90% protein and 95% peptide probability thresholds (Prophet scores) and requir-
ingatleast 2unique peptides perprotein. The resulting mass spectrometry analysis isgiven in
S3Table after manual pruning bycore staff ofcommon contaminants (e.g., human keratin).
Miller assay
Cells containing thelacZ reporter controlled bysdaC promoter variants (see strain construc-
tion notes above) were grown overnight inM9RDM media with 0.4% glucose. Inthemorn-
ing, cells were diluted 1:300 infresh, prewarmed M9RDM media with 0.4% glucose in96-well
plate. The plate wasplaced inaBioTek Synergy H1(BioTek, Winooski, VT) plate reader mea-
suring OD600 and grown until mid-exponential phase, around 6doublings. Once thecells
reached thetarget ODofaround 0.2(1-cm path length equivalent), 80uLofcells were placed
inanew 96-well plate and mixed with 120uLof β-galactosidase assay mix (see below), avoid-
ingtheproduction ofbubbles. The plate wasloaded into thesame Synergy H1plate reader
and incubated at37˚C, taking measurements every 2minutes for1hour. Our procedure,
assay, and analysis fortheMiller assay areadapted from [78].
Reagents:
•Z-buffer: 60mM Na2HPO 4,40mM NaH 2PO 4,10mM KCl, 1mM MgSO 4
•β-mercaptoethanol solution: 2.7μl/mL β-mercaptoethanol inZ-Buffer

•200μlLysozyme solution.
Wethen calculated theenzymatic activity ineach well first bysubtracting 1.7times the
OD550 value ateach time point from theOD420 value (toyield theamount ofenzymatic
product after correcting forcelldebris) and then fitting aLOESS smoothing curve tothe
resulting values and identifying thepoint ofmaximal slope; that slope (which isarate of
increase inproduct versus time) istaken astheenzymatic activity. The background activity of
MG1655 lacZ::cml cells measured atthesame time wasthen subtracted from each data point.
The activities were then divided bytheOD600 ofthecorresponding cells used ineach assay to
account forthediffering amounts ofbiological starting material toyield final OD-normalized
Miller units. The experiments were performed intechnical duplicate oneach of4different
days.
The resulting normalized Miller values were then analyzed using aBayesian mixed-effects
model toidentify therelative promoter activities inour8strains ofinterest. Weassumed that

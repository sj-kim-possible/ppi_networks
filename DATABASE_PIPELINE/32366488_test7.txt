ABSTRACT
Background: The novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),
infected over 3300 healthcare workers in early 2020 in China. Little information is known about
nosocomial infections of healthcare workers in the initial period. We analysed data from healthcare
workers with nosocomial infections in Wuhan Union Hospital (Wuhan, China) and their family
members.
Methods: We collected and analysed data on exposure history, illness timelines and epidemiological
characteristics from 25 healthcareworkers withlaboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
and two healthcare workers in whom COVID-19 was highly suspected, as well as 10 of their family
members with COVID-19, between 5 January and 12 February 2020. The demographics and clinical
features of the 35 laboratory-confirmed cases were investigated and viral RNA of 12 cases was sequenced
andanalysed.
Results: Nine clusters were found among the patients. All patients showed mild to moderate clinical
manifestation and recovered without deterioration. The mean period of incubation was 4.5days, the
mean±SD clinical onset serial interval (COSI) was 5.2±3.2days, and the median virus shedding time was
18.5days. Complete genomic sequences of 12 different coronavirus strains demonstrated that the viral
structure, with small irrelevant mutations, was stable in the transmission chains and showed remarkable
traitsofinfectioustraceability.
Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 can be rapidly transmitted from person to person, regardless of whether they
havesymptoms,inbothhospitalsettingsandsocialactivities,basedontheshortperiodofincubationand
COSI. The public health service should take practical measures to curb the spread, including isolation of
cases, tracing close contacts, and containment of severe epidemic areas. Besides this, healthcare workers
shouldbealertduringtheepidemicandself-quarantineifself-suspectedofinfection.

Introduction
17years after the 2003 epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [1, 2], a novel coronavirus,
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage
of several patients with unknown origin pneumonia in Wuhan City, China [3]. SARS-CoV-2 has caused
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) across the country and abroad. A total of 83157 COVID-19 cases
with 4.02% mortality has been reported in China up to 7 April 2020 [4]. The confirmed cases have been
identified in >180 countries and regions around the world, and >1300000 people have been infected
globally outside China, including 78932 deaths [5]. The hunt for patient zero is critical, but
epidemiological investigations are often complex and unclear [6]. A COVID-19 patient usually presents
with fever, a nonproductive cough, myalgia and malaise. Symptoms, including a productive cough and
headache, are less common. Dyspnoea is observed in more than one-quarter of patients. Cases with
persistent lymphopenia usually develop fatal comorbidities, including acute respiratory distress syndrome,
acutecardiacinjury,secondaryinfectionandmultiorgandysfunction[7–9].
SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense and single-stranded RNA virus of zoonotic origin belonging to
Betacoronavirus lineage B [3]. It has successfully crossed the animal-to-human barrier and proved to be
capable of epidemic spread and may even have endemic persistence in the human population [10]. The
calculatedR0ofSARS-CoV-2isashighas2.68[11],makingpreventionmeasuresandinterventiontactics
very challenging. Unfortunately, current general hospital settings in Wuhan and many other cities are
actingasepidemichotspotstofacilitatetransmissionandexacerbatespread[12].Sofar,>3300healthcare
workers(HCWs)inChinahavebeendiagnosedasinfected,mainlythroughnosocomialtransmission[13].
HCWs are among the first to suffer during the epidemic. The transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in
hospitals in the initial period, especially among HCWs, are important for deeper understanding of the
epidemiologyofthedisease.
Here we investigated possible transmission links by integrating epidemiological data and whole-genome
sequencingof25infectedHCWsandtwoHCWsinwhominfectionwashighlysuspected,aswellastheir
family members who were successively infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the initial period in Wuhan Union
Hospital. We also collected and analysed the clinical data of the 35 laboratory-confirmed cases among
theseindividuals.
Methods
Studydesignandparticipants
A total of 35 laboratory-confirmed cases and two highlysuspected cases were enrolled between 5 January
and 12 February 2020, including 27 HCWs and 10 relatives out of seven families. All participants were
interviewed using a standard questionnaire that elevated communicable diseases. Items such as HCWs’
contact history with the confirmed COVID-19 patients, including where, when and how they had been
exposed, were assessed. We mapped all cases with the precise time of symptom onset. Cluster outbreaks,
potentialexposuresandpossiblepatternsoftransmissionwereestimated.
We collected clinical data from the 35 laboratory-confirmed cases, including symptoms and signs,
laboratory examinations, chest imaging, comorbidities and complications, and clinical treatment and
outcomes, which were arranged using a standardised data collection form, referencing the case record
form shared by the International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC)
[14] and the household transmission investigation protocol for SARS-CoV-2 infection from the World
HealthOrganization(WHO)[15].

Real-timereversetranscriptionPCRassaytodetectSARS-CoV-2
TheSARS-CoV-2laboratorytestassayswerebasedonthepreviousWHOrecommendation[16].RNAwas
extracted from oropharyngeal swabs of patients suspected of having SARS-CoV-2 infection using the
respiratory sample RNA isolation kit. Then real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) assay of
SARS-CoV-2RNAwasconducted toamplifyand test two target genes, including open reading frame1ab
(ORF1ab) and nucleocapsid protein (N). Details of the manufacturer’s protocols for RNA extraction and
real-timeRT-PCRassay,andthediagnosticcriteria,areillustratedinthesupplementarymaterial.
Whole-genomesequencingandcomparativegenomeanalysis
Nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal swabs were obtained from all COVID-19 cases for SARS-CoV-2
nucleic acid assay, and 22 were processed using whole-genome sequencing. Full genomes were sequenced
using the BioelectronSeq 4000 (CapitalBio Corporation, Beijing, China) and assembled using the de novo
genome assembler, SPAdes, version 3.10.1 [17]. The complete genome was annotated by Prokka, version
1.14.5[18].ThemutationswereanalysedwiththeuseofC-Sibelia,version3.07[19],basedontheexisting
Wuhan-Hu-1 (NC_045512.2) genome, and were annotated by SnpEff, version 4.3 [20]. We integrated
informationfrom60publishedgenomicsequencesofSARS-CoV-2.
Full-length genomes were combined with published SARS-CoV-2 genomes and other coronaviruses and
aligned using the FFT-NS-2 model by MAFFT, version 7.455 [21].Maximum-likelihood phylogenies were
inferred under a generalised-time-reversal (GTR)+ gamma substitution model and bootstrapped 1000
times to assess confidence using RAxML, version 8.2.12 [22]. The mutations of assembled amino acid
sequences of Spike protein were compared with Wuhan-Hu-1 (NC_045512.2), bat-SL-CoVZC45
(MG772933.1)andSARScoronavirusisolateTor2/FP1-10851(JX163927.1)usingClustalOmega[23].
Epidemiologicalanalysis
For participants with detailed onset information, a log-normal distribution was used to fit the incubation
period, and the probability distribution of the incubation period was estimated. For participants with
detailed medical visit information, the Weibull distribution was used to fit and determine
onset-to-first-medical-visit and onset-to-admission distributions based on the dates of the onset of the
illness, first medical visit and hospital admission. The clinical onset serial interval (COSI) was calculated,
forwhichtheprobabilitydistributionwasestimatedbythegammadistribution.
Statisticalanalysis
For clinical data, categorical variables were expressed as number (proportion). Continuous variables were
expressed as medians and compared by Mann–Whitney U-tests. p-values <0.05 were considered
significant. Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS software, version 23.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk,
NY,USA),unlessotherwiseindicated.
Ethicalapproval
Ethical approval was waived by the institutional review board of the hospital, since we collected and
analysed all data from the patients according to the policy for public health outbreak investigation of
emerginginfectiousdiseasesissuedbytheNationalHealthCommissionofthePeople’sRepublicofChina.

Transmission,incubationperiodandserialinterval
According to the information from 14 laboratory-confirmed cases whohad specific dates of exposure and
symptom onset, we estimated that the mean incubation period was 4.5days (95% CI 3.0–6.4days). The
95th percentile of the probability distribution for the incubation period was 11.4days (95% CI 4.0–
12.0days)(figure2a).Throughtheninetransmissionchains(figure1b),weestimatedthatthemean±SDof
the COSI distribution was 5.2±3.2days (95% CI 3.8–6.8days) (figure 2b). Among the data obtained from
the 35 confirmed cases (including the HCWs and their family members) and two suspected cases, the
intervalfromthedateofonsettothefirstmedicalvisitwasestimatedtohaveameanof3.0days(95%CI
2.2–3.9days) (figure 2c). Of the 27 hospitalised cases (23 HCWs and four family members), the interval
from the date of onset to hospital admission was estimated to have a mean of 6.6days (95% CI 5.3–
8.2days) (figure 2d). There were no significant differences in these four indicators between HCWs and
theirfamilymembers.

On admission, infiltrations in chest computed tomography (CT) images were detected in most cases. In
total, 29 (82.9%) showed ground-glass opacities, four (11.4%) showed consolidations, and one (2.9%)
presented mixed ground-glass opacities and consolidation. Only one patient (2.9%) had normal chest
imaging (supplementary table S2). Figure 3 shows two series of typical CT images of moderate
pneumonia (HCWs A and C) and supplementary figure S5 shows a series of CT images from a
suspectedcase(HCWO).
Sequencingandphylogeneticanalysis
We obtained 12 whole-genome sequences (GenBank accession numbers MT079843–MT079854) after
implementing de novo sequencing from 22 swab specimens from 22 COVID-19 patients. These 12
whole-genomesequenceswerefrompatientsB,C,E,F,G,H,J,M,Q,R,Vande,aslabelledinfigure1b,
and their corresponding sample numbers are summarised in supplementary table S3. The remaining 10
samples were removed due to insufficient coverage of the extracted virus genome. Compared with
Wuhan-Hu-1, except for V, the remaining 11 viral genomes all had two nucleotide mutations. We found

found in the 12 genomes of SARS-CoV-2 strains, but none of them were located in the genes for
structural proteins in the new coronavirus, including S, E, M or N proteins (figure 4a). Five of the
mutations were located on the nonstructural proteins, which are hydrolysed from the virus-encoded
polyproteins 1a/1ab1. The one remaining missense mutation (position 28144, T>C) was located on the

Discussion
At the very early stage of the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan City and Hubei Province in China, we
lacked efficient viral identification capacity to diagnose probable COVID-19 cases. Therewere no effective
prevention measures in general hospital settingsto isolate and manage the suspected COVID-19 cases, or
valid containment measures to block the transmission pathways [12]. HCWs are the highest risk
occupational population in outbreaks of such acute respiratory infectious diseases, such as SARS and
COVID-19, which are transmitted by contact or respiratory droplets, aerosols or fomites [24]. Here, we
havedescribedseveralclustersofCOVID-19casesinahospital,showingperson-to-persontransmissionof
SARS-CoV-2,andhaveassessedtheepidemiologicalfeaturesofCOVID-19.
Wehavereported25laboratory-confirmed casesandtwohighlysuspectedcasesamongHCWs,whowere
infected successively in Wuhan Union Hospital. Of these, 14 were co-workers in the Department of
Neurosurgery.Theyformedtwoclusters,withtwoindexpatientsasthesources,whichfurtheremphasised
theimportanceofadequateprotectionforHCWsduringtheirdailywork.Moreover,sevenfamilyclusters
associated with these HCWs have occurred, mainly due to the close contact between the affected HCWs
and their family members without any isolation measures. Fortunately, the majority of HCWs, who
isolated themselves from their family members at the onset of illness, effectively protected their family
members from getting infected. Through mapping the time of onset and possible routes of transmission
(figure 1b), we can conclude that the general hospitals are just like an epidemic hub, gathering a lot of
patientswhoarethesourcesofinfection,whichwouldefficientlyfacilitateandexacerbatethetransmission
andspreadingofvirusviapublictransportoralternativeways.
Through phylogenetic analysis, we found clustered cases that were closer in the phylogenetic tree
(figure 4b). Mutation analysis showed that the sequence from each sample had different mutation sites,
most of which were synonymous mutations. Although some missense mutations existed, none of them
were located in the genes for structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 (figure 4a). Additionally, the amino acid
sequencesofthestructuralproteinshadnochanges(supplementaryfiguresS1andS2).
Mostoftheinitialsymptomsinourcasesweremyalgia,malaiseandfever.Somepatientshadnofeverbut

illness to hospital admission were estimated to have a mean of 3.0days and 6.6days, respectively, which
were shorter than in other studies [25]. By 12 February, 21 out of 27 hospitalised cases (77.8%) had
recovered and were discharged; none of them were admitted to the intensive care unit or had died. From
the chest CT images from HCWs A and C, very mild or moderate infiltrations were presented, and these
became alleviatedand resolved significantly in ashorttime(figure 3).Thus, early diagnosis, isolation and
timelytreatmentscanspeeduptherecoveryofpatientsanddecreasethedeteriorativetendency.
Themediantimeforvirussheddingtobecomenegativeinourcaseswasalongperiodof18.5days(range
12–25days). It is worth mentioning that nurse F suffered severe diarrhoea during hospitalisation. Even
after the nucleic acid test of nasopharyngeal swabs turned negative and lung CT images got better, the
viral nucleic acid test of the stool maintained a sustainable positive result, 1month after onset. We must
thus pay close attention to the status of virus clearance of patients with COVID-19. Such a long virus

to extend the period of hospitalisation for infectious control purposes, and we should adopt a prudent
strategyfortreatingcriticallyseverepatientswithconvalescentplasmafromCOVID-19patients.
Our current study has some limitations. First, only 37 patients were enrolled, which might have led to
potential bias of the incubation period and COSI in our study. More accurate calculation of incubation
periodandCOSIwouldbepossiblewithalargersamplesize.Secondly,theinvestigationofthekineticsof
virus shedding and the relevant viral loading in both respiratory and intestinal tracts was not possible,
since the novel causative pathogen has only just been identified. Thirdly, the potential for superficial
exposure in infection transmission was not investigated, which may need further studies. Fourthly, the
kinetics of viral antibodies, especially neutralised antibodies, were not monitored due to laboratory
limitations. Finally, viral genome analysis and traceability from each patient have notbeen performed and
shouldbeconductedinfuturestudies.
In summary, similar to the 2003 SARS outbreak in Guangzhou, the current epidemic of SARS-CoV-2
resulting in COVID-19 in Wuhan is mainly due to efficient person-to-person transmission or
super-spreading events in hospital settings and social activities, based on the short period of incubation
and COSI. Practical strategies and measures, such as isolation of patients, tracing and quarantine of close
contacts and containment of severe epidemic areas, are crucial to block the spread. Earlier detection and
diagnosisofpatientswithCOVID-19willresultinbetterprognoses.

This is the GitHub repository for code and analysis built pertaining to https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jproteome.4c00535
This project was ultimately divided into two parts, separated into a Literature inquiry and a Database inquiry. 
The Literature inquiry extracted papers associated with a species of interest (E.coli) and measured protein interactions using a dictionary of uniprot IDs and protein synonyms.
The Database inquiry extracted interactions from [IntAct](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/home).

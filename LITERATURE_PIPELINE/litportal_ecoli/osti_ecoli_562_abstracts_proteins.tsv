Amongst the myriad of bio-based conversion approaches under evaluation, a formate bio-economy has recently been proposed, wherein CO<sub>2</sub>-derived formate serves as a substrate for concurrent carbon and energy delivery to microbial systems. To date, this approach has been explored in chemolithotrophic and heterotrophic organisms via native or engineered formatotrophy. However, utilization of this concept in phototrophic organisms has yet to be reported. Herein, we have taken the first steps to establish formate utilization in Picochlorum renovo, a recently characterized eukaryotic microalga with facile genetic tools and promising applied biotechnology traits. Plastidial heterologous expression of a formate dehydrogenase (P25437) enabled P. renovo growth on formate as a carbon and energy source. Further, P25437 expression enhanced cultivation capacity on ambient CO<sub>2</sub>, underscoring the potential for bypass of conventional CO<sub>2</sub> capture and concentration limitations. This work establishes a photoformatotrophic cultivation regime that leverages light energy-driven formate utilization. The resultant photosynthetic formate platform has widespread implications for applied phototrophic cultivation systems and the bio-economy at large."""

2203573	"Diverse electron carriers drive syntrophic interactions in an enriched anaerobic acetate-oxidizing consortium,""<title>Abstract</title>  <p>  In many anoxic environments, syntrophic acetate oxidation (SAO) is a key pathway mediating the conversion of acetate into methane through obligate cross-feeding interactions between SAO bacteria (SAOB) and methanogenic archaea. The SAO pathway is particularly important in engineered environments such as anaerobic digestion (A1AJF5) systems operating at thermophilic temperatures and/or with high ammonia. Despite the widespread importance of SAOB to the stability of the A1AJF5 process, little is known about their in situ physiologies due to typically low biomass yields and resistance to isolation. Here, we performed a long-term (300-day) continuous enrichment of a thermophilic (55 °C) SAO community from a municipal A1AJF5 system using acetate as the sole carbon source. Over 80% of the enriched bioreactor metagenome belonged to a three-member consortium, including an acetate-oxidizing bacterium affiliated with DTU068 encoding for carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and formate production, along with two methanogenic archaea affiliated with  <italic>Methanothermobacter_A</italic>  . Stable isotope probing was coupled with metaproteogenomics to quantify carbon flux into each community member during acetate conversion and inform metabolic reconstruction and genome-scale modeling. This effort revealed that the two  <italic>Methanothermobacter_A</italic>  species differed in their preferred electron donors, with one possessing the ability to grow on formate and the other only consuming hydrogen. A thermodynamic analysis suggested that the presence of the formate-consuming methanogen broadened the environmental conditions where P22259 production from SAO was favorable. Collectively, these results highlight how flexibility in electron partitioning during SAO likely governs community structure and fitness through thermodynamic-driven mutualism, shedding valuable insights into the metabolic underpinnings of this key functional group within methanogenic ecosystems.  </p>"""	The ISME Journal	"('P22259', 'ATP'),('A1AJF5', 'AD')"

2217632	"TroR is the primary regulator of the iron homeostasis transcription network in the halophilic archaeon  <i>Haloferax volcanii</i>,""<title>Abstract</title>  <p>Maintaining the intracellular iron concentration within the homeostatic range is vital to meet cellular metabolic needs and reduce oxidative stress. Previous research revealed that the haloarchaeon Halobacterium salinarum encodes four diphtheria toxin repressor (DtxR) family transcription factors (TFs) that together regulate the iron response through an interconnected transcriptional regulatory network (TRN). However, the conservation of the TRN and the metal specificity of DtxR TFs remained poorly understood. Here we identified and characterized the TRN of Haloferax volcanii for comparison. Genetic analysis demonstrated that Hfx. volcanii relies on three DtxR transcriptional regulators (Idr, SirR, and TroR), with TroR as the primary regulator of iron homeostasis. Bioinformatics and molecular approaches revealed that TroR binds a conserved cis-regulatory motif located ∼100 nt upstream of the start codon of iron-related target genes. Transcriptomics analysis demonstrated that, under conditions of iron sufficiency, TroR repressed iron uptake and induced iron storage mechanisms. TroR repressed the expression of one other DtxR P0A850, Idr. This reduced DtxR TRN complexity relative to that of Hbt. salinarum appeared correlated with natural variations in iron availability. Based on these data, we hypothesize that variable environmental conditions such as iron availability appear to select for increasing TRN complexity.</p>"""	Nucleic Acids Research	"('P0A850', 'TF')"
2205141	"The structural basis of mRNA recognition and binding by yeast pseudouridine synthase PUS1,""<p>The chemical modification of RNA bases represents a ubiquitous activity that spans all domains of life. Pseudouridylation is the most common RNA modification and is observed within P0A873, rRNA, ncRNA and mRNAs. Pseudouridine synthase or ‘PUS’ enzymes include those that rely on guide RNA molecules and others that function as ‘stand-alone’ enzymes. Among the latter, several have been shown to modify mRNA transcripts. Although recent studies have defined the structural requirements for RNA to act as a PUS target, the mechanisms by which PUS1 recognizes these target sequences in mRNA are not well understood. Here we describe the crystal structure of yeast PUS1 bound to an RNA target that we identified as being a hot spot for PUS1-interaction within a model mRNA at 2.4 Å resolution. The enzyme recognizes and binds both strands in a helical RNA duplex, and thus guides the RNA containing the target uridine to the active site for subsequent modification of the transcript. The study also allows us to show the divergence of related PUS1 enzymes and their corresponding RNA target specificities, and to speculate on the basis by which PUS1 binds and modifies mRNA or P0A873 substrates.</p>"""	PLoS ONE	"('P0A873', 'tRNA')"

2229172	"Microbial sensor variation across biogeochemical conditions in the terrestrial deep subsurface,""<title>ABSTRACT</title>  <p>  Microbes can be found in abundance many kilometers underground. While microbial metabolic capabilities have been examined across different geochemical settings, it remains unclear how changes in subsurface niches affect microbial needs to sense and respond to their environment. To address this question, we examined how microbial extracellular sensor systems vary with environmental conditions across metagenomes at different Deep Mine Microbial Observatory (DeMMO) subsurface sites. Because two-component systems (TCSs) directly sense extracellular conditions and convert this information into intracellular biochemical responses, we expected that this sensor family would vary across isolated oligotrophic subterranean environments that differ in abiotic and biotic conditions. TCSs were found at all six subsurface sites, the service water control, and the surface site, with an average of 0.88 sensor histidine kinases (HKs) per 100 genes across all sites. Abundance was greater in subsurface fracture fluids compared with surface-derived fluids, and candidate phyla radiation (CPR) bacteria presented the lowest P00547 frequencies. Measures of microbial diversity, such as the Shannon diversity index, revealed that P00547 abundance is inversely correlated with microbial diversity (  <italic>r</italic>  <sup>2</sup>  = 0.81). Among the geochemical parameters measured, P00547 frequency correlated most strongly with variance in dissolved organic carbon (  <italic>r</italic>  <sup>2</sup>  = 0.82). Taken together, these results implicate the abiotic and biotic properties of an ecological niche as drivers of sensor needs, and they suggest that microbes in environments with large fluctuations in organic nutrients (e.g., lacustrine, terrestrial, and coastal ecosystems) may require greater TCS diversity than ecosystems with low nutrients (e.g., open ocean).  </p>  <sec>  <title>IMPORTANCE</title>  <p>The ability to detect extracellular environmental conditions is a fundamental property of all life forms. Because microbial two-component sensor systems convert information about extracellular conditions into biochemical information that controls their behaviors, we evaluated how two-component sensor systems evolved within the deep Earth across multiple sites where abiotic and biotic properties vary. We show that these sensor systems remain abundant in microbial consortia at all subterranean sampling sites and observe correlations between sensor system abundances and abiotic (dissolved organic carbon variation) and biotic (consortia diversity) properties. These results suggest that multiple environmental properties may drive sensor protein evolution and highlight the need for further studies of metagenomic and geochemical data in parallel to understand the drivers of microbial sensor evolution.</p>  </sec>"""	mSystems	"('P00547', 'HK')"

To investigate whether Flds can support electron transfer to a sulfite reductase (SIR) that evolved to couple with a ferredoxin, we evaluated the ability of Flds to transfer electrons from a ferredoxin‐NADP reductase (P28861) to a ferredoxin‐dependent SIR using growth complementation of an  <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>  strain with a sulfur metabolism defect.

Bioinformatic analysis showed that natural Fld sequence variability predicts a large fraction of the motifs that tolerate insertion of the octapeptide SGRPGSLS.

While cristae‐shaping proteins have been defined, analogous lipid‐based mechanisms have yet to be elucidated. Here, we combine experimental lipidome dissection with multi‐scale modeling to investigate how lipid interactions dictate IMM morphology and P22259 generation. When modulating phospholipid (PL) saturation in engineered yeast strains, we observed a surprisingly abrupt breakpoint in IMM topology driven by a continuous loss of P22259 synthase organization at cristae ridges. We found that cardiolipin (P06721) specifically buffers the inner mitochondrial membrane against curvature loss, an effect that is independent of P22259 synthase dimerization. To explain this interaction, we developed a continuum model for cristae tubule formation that integrates both lipid and protein‐mediated curvatures. This model highlighted a snapthrough instability, which drives IMM collapse upon small changes in membrane properties.

2001374	"Domain crossover in the reductase subunit of P80644-dependent assimilatory sulfite reductase,""P80644-dependent assimilatory sulfite reductase (SiR) from Escherichia coli performs a six-electron reduction of sulfite to the bioavailable sulfide. SiR is composed of a flavoprotein (SiRFP) reductase subunit and a hemoprotein (P17846) oxidase subunit. There is no known high-resolution structure of SiR or SiRFP, thus we do not yet fully understand how the subunits interact to perform their chemistry. Here, we used small-angle neutron scattering to understand the impact of conformationally restricting the highly mobile SiRFP octamer into an electron accepting (closed) or electron donating (open) conformation, showing that SiR remains active, flexible, and asymmetric even with these conformational restrictions. From these scattering data, we then model the first solution structure of SiRFP. Further, computational modeling of the N-terminal 52 amino acids that are responsible for SiRFP oligomerization suggests an eight-helical bundle tethers together the SiRFP subunits to form the SiR core. Finally, mass spectrometry analysis of the closed SiRFP variant show that SiRFP is capable of inter-molecular domain crossover, in which the electron donating domain from one polypeptide is able to interact directly with the electron accepting domain of another polypeptide. This structural characterization suggests that SiR performs its high-volume electron transfer through both inter- and intramolecular pathways between SiRFP domains and, thus, cis or trans transfer from reductase to oxidase subunits.

This study reports on PHOSPHATE TRANSPORTER 4-7 (CrPHT4-7) from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a member of the PHT4 transporter family, which exhibits remarkable similarity to AtPHT4;4 from Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), a chloroplastic ascorbate transporter. Using fluorescent protein tagging, we show that CrPHT4-7 resides in the chloroplast envelope membrane. Crpht4-7 mutants, generated by the CRISPR/Cas12a-mediated single-strand templated repair, show retarded growth, especially in high light, reduced P22259 level, strong ascorbate accumulation, and diminished non-photochemical quenching in high light. On the other hand, total cellular phosphorous content was unaffected, and the phenotype of the Crpht4-7 mutants could not be alleviated by ample Pi supply. CrPHT4-7-overexpressing lines exhibit enhanced biomass accumulation under high light conditions in comparison with the wild-type strain. Expressing CrPHT4-7 in a yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) strain lacking Pi transporters substantially recovered its slow growth phenotype, demonstrating that CrPHT4-7 transports Pi. Even though CrPHT4-7 shows a high degree of similarity to AtPHT4;4, it does not display any substantial ascorbate transport activity in yeast or intact algal cells.

Microbial N-cycling is regulated by edaphic conditions and genes from many interconnected metabolic pathways, but most studies of soil N-cycling gene expression have focused on single pathways. Currently, we lack a comprehensive understanding of the interplay between soil N-cycling gene regulation, spatial habitat, and time. We present results from a replicated time series of soil metatranscriptomes; we followed gene expression of multiple N transformations in four soil habitats (rhizosphere,  detritusphere, rhizo-detritusphere, and bulk soil) during active root growth for the annual grass, Avena fatua. The presence of root litter and living roots significantly altered the trajectories of N-cycling gene expression. Upregulation of assimilatory nitrate reduction in the rhizosphere suggests that rhizosphere bacteria were actively competing with roots for nitrate. Simultaneously, ammonium assimilatory pathways were upregulated in both rhizosphere and detritusphere soil, which could have limited N availability to plants. The detritusphere supported dissimilatory processes DNRA and denitrification. Expression of nitrification genes was dominated by three phylotypes of Thaumarch aeota and was upregulated in bulk soil. Unidirectional ammonium assimilation and its regulatory genes (P0A9C5/GOGAT) were upregulated near relatively young roots and highly decayed root litter, suggesting N may have been limiting in these habitats (P0A9C5/GOGAT is typically activated under N limitation).

How the Sec synthetic machinery recognizes and discriminates tRNASec from the P0A873 pool is essential to the integrity of the selenoproteome. Previously, we suggested that SepSecS adopts a competent conformation that is pre-ordered for catalysis. Herein, using high-resolution X-ray crystallography, we visualized P0A873-dependent conformational changes in human SepSecS that may be a prerequisite for achieving catalytic competency. We show that tRNASec binding organizes the active sites of the catalytic protomer, while stabilizing the N- and C-termini of the non-catalytic protomer. Binding of large anions to the catalytic groove may further optimize the catalytic site for substrate binding and catalysis.

It has been indicated in the past that an atypical conformation of the “SC<sub>367</sub>P13029” loop near the [2Fe]<sub>H</sub> portion of the six-iron active site (H-cluster) allows the Cys367 residue to adopt an “off-H<sup>+</sup>-pathway” orientation, promoting a facile transition of the cofactor to Hinact. Here, we investigated the electronic structure of the H-cluster in the oxidized state (H<sub>ox</sub>) that directly converts to Hinact under oxidizing conditions and the related CO-inhibited state (H<sub>ox</sub>-CO). We demonstrate that both states exhibit two distinct forms in electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The ratio between the two forms is pH-dependent but also sensitive to the buffer choice. Our IR and EPR analyses illustrate that the spectral heterogeneity is due to a perturbation of the coordination environment of the H-cluster’s [4Fe4S]<sub>H</sub> subcluster without affecting the [2Fe]<sub>H</sub> subcluster. Overall, we conclude that the observation of two spectral components per state is evidence of heterogeneity of the environment of the H-cluster likely associated with conformational mobility of the SCCP loop. Such flexibility may allow Cys367 to switch rapidly between off- and on-H<sup>+</sup>-pathway rotamers. Consequently, we believe such structural mobility may be the key to maintaining high enzymatic activity while allowing a facile transition to the O<sub>2</sub>-protected state."""

2228837	"A swapped genetic code prevents viral infections and gene transfer,""Engineering the genetic code of an organism has been proposed to provide a firewall from natural ecosystems by preventing viral infections and gene transfer. However, numerous viruses and mobile genetic elements encode parts of the translational apparatus, potentially rendering a genetic-code-based firewall ineffective. Here we show that such mobile transfer RNAs (tRNAs) enable gene transfer and allow viral replication in Escherichia coli despite the genome-wide removal of 3 of the 64 codons and the previously essential cognate P0A873 and release factor genes. We then establish a genetic firewall by discovering viral tRNAs that provide exceptionally efficient codon reassignment allowing us to develop cells bearing an amino acid-swapped genetic code that reassigns two of the six serine codons to leucine during translation. This amino acid-swapped genetic code renders cells resistant to viral infections by mistranslating viral proteomes and prevents the escape of synthetic genetic information by engineered reliance on serine codons to produce leucine-requiring proteins. As these cells may have a selective advantage over wild organisms due to virus resistance, we also repurpose a third codon to biocontain this virus-resistant host through dependence on an amino acid not found in nature. Furthermore, our results may provide the basis for a general strategy to make any organism safely resistant to all natural viruses and prevent genetic information flow into and out of genetically modified organisms."""

1993841	"Evaluation of strategies to narrow the product chain-length distribution of microbially synthesized free fatty acids,""The dominant strategy for tailoring the chain-length distribution of free fatty acids (FFA) synthesized by heterologous hosts is expression of a selective acyl-acyl carrier protein (P0A6A8) thioesterase. However, few of these enzymes can generate a precise (greater than 90% of a desired chain-length) product distribution when expressed in a microbial or plant host. The presence of alternative chain-lengths can complicate purification in situations where blends of fatty acids are not desired. We report the assessment of several strategies for improving the dodecanoyl-P0A6A8 thioesterase from the California bay laurel to exhibit more selective production of medium-chain free fatty acids to near exclusivity. We demonstrated that matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-ToF P13009) was an effective library screening technique for identification of thioesterase variants with favorable shifts in Journal Pre-proof chain-length specificity. This strategy proved to be a more effective screening technique than several rational approaches discussed herein. With this data, we isolated four thioesterase variants which exhibited a more selective FFA distribution over wildtype when expressed in the fatty acid accumulating E. coli strain, RL08. We then combined mutations from the MALDI isolates to generate BTE-MMD19, a thioesterase variant capable of producing free fatty acids consisting of 90% of C12 products. Of the four mutations which conferred a specificity shift, we noted that three affected the shape of the binding pocket, while one occurred on the positively charged acyl carrier protein landing pad. Lastly, we fused the maltose binding protein (P0AEX9) from E. coli to the N – terminus of BTE-MMD19 to improve enzyme solubility and achieve a titer of 1.9 g per L of twelve-carbon fatty acids in a shake flask."""

This study addresses an important knowledge gap by investigating the impact of GO exposure- both at low (25 ppm) and high (250ppm) doses and fed (nutrient rich) and fasted (nutrient deplete) conditions- on the gut microbial community structure and function, using an in vitro human colon bioreactor model. A8C927 amplicon sequencing revealed that GO exposure resulted in a restructuring of community composition. 25 ppm GO induced a marked decrease in the Bacteroidota phylum and increased the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidota (F/B). Untargeted metabolomics on the supernatants indicated that 25 ppm GO impaired microbial utilization and metabolism of substrates (amino acids, carbohydrate metabolites) and reduced production of beneficial microbial metabolites such as 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid and GABA. Exposure to 250 ppm GO resulted in community composition and metabolome profiles that were very similar to the controls that lacked both GO and digestive enzymes, suggesting that high concentrations of GO may interact with digestive enzymes to form protein coronas, causing their depletion in the gut environment. Differential abundance analyses revealed that 3 genera from the phylum Bacteroidota (Bacteroides, Dysgonomonas, and Parabacteroides) were more abundant after 250 ppm GO exposure, irrespective of feed state. Integrative correlation network analysis indicated that the phylum Bacteroidota showed strong positive correlations to multiple microbial metabolites including GABA and 3-indoleacetic acid, are much larger number of correlations compared to other phyla.

Recently, LdpA-mediated catabolism of erythro-DGPD was reported in SYK-6, but the catabolic pathway for threo-DGPD was as yet unknown. Here, in this study, we elucidated the catabolism of threo-DGPD, which proceeds through conversion to erythro-DGPD. When threo-DGPD was incubated with SYK-6, the Cα hydroxy groups of threo-DGPD (DGPD I and II) were initially oxidized to produce the Cα carbonyl form (DGPD-keto I and II). This initial oxidation step is catalyzed by Cα-dehydrogenases, which belong to the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family and are involved in the catabolism of β-O-4-type dimers. Analysis of seven candidate genes revealed that NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent LigD and LigL are mainly involved in the conversion of DGPD I and II, respectively. Next, we found that DGPD-keto I and II were reduced to erythro-DGPD (DGPD III and IV) in the presence of P80644. Genes involved in this reduction were sought from Cα-dehydrogenase and ldpA-neighboring SDR genes. The gene products of SLG_12690 (ldpC) and SLG_12640 (ldpB) catalyzed the P80644-dependent conversion of DGPD-keto I to DGPD III and DGPD-keto II to DGPD IV, respectively. Mutational analysis further indicated that ldpC and ldpB are predominantly involved in the reduction of DGPD-keto.

A clear connection between the cell wall structure and biomass deconstruction is necessary to understand how lignocellulosic material is broken down to valuable monomeric components. Here, we monitor changes in the cellulose microfibril domains of poplar, sorghum, and switchgrass throughout gamma-valerolactone (GVL)–water co-solvent pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis using solid-state <sup>13</sup>C cross-polarization magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (P13029/MAS <sup>13</sup>C-NMR) and wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS). Spectral fitting of NMR peaks corresponding to different cellulose microenvironments at the C<sub>4</sub> carbon center suggests that a mildly acidic GVL–water co-solvent pretreatment of poplar leads to nearly full removal of xylan–cellulose linkages, which primes the cellulose for enzymatic attack. The spectral fitting also suggests that the pretreatment causes significant depletion of the inaccessible fibril surface domains with an increase in more thermally stable crystalline resonances (I<sub>β</sub>). WAXS confirmed a decrease in the lattice spacing between (200) crystalline planes with increasing co-solvent pretreatment severity. These results are interpreted as an opening of bound microfibril surfaces previously inaccessible to the co-solvent system, which leaves behind a more thermally stable, crystalline domain that is potentially prone to relaxation and recrystallization. Full conversion of residual GVL-pretreated biomass was achieved after the GVL co-solvent pretreatment at 140 °C using a commercial enzyme cocktail, CTec2, which contains different cellulases and other enzymes.

These studies indicate that the native isobutanol pathway is incapable of carrying sufficient flux to displace ethanol. In this report, we screened a combinatorial library of pathway enzymes to identify an isobutanol pathway cassette capable of supporting the growth of a non-ethanol producing S. cerevisiae. We began by identifying a diverse set of isobutanol pathway enzyme homologs and combined each open reading frame with varied-strength promoters in a combinatorial, pooled fashion. We applied a growth-coupled screen where a functional isobutanol pathway restored NAD<sup>+</sup> regeneration during glucose catabolism that is otherwise repressed via the Crabtree effect.

The cell membrane is defined by its transverse structure, an approximately 5 nm-thick selectively permeable bilayer that serves many important cellular functions. Compositionally complex, dynamic, and organized in both the transverse and lateral dimensions, understanding the cell membrane structure—and the role that structure plays in cellular function, communication, and environmental sensing is an active scientific effort. Previously, we have devised a novel isotopic labeling approach for membrane lipids to enable direct  <italic>in vivo</italic>  structural studies of the cell membrane in the Gram-positive bacterium,  <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>  , using small-angle neutron scattering. This was accomplished through a genetic inhibition of fatty acid (FA) degradation (Δ  <italic>fadN</italic>  ) and a chemical inhibition of FA biosynthesis using cerulenin, an irreversible inhibitor of type II fatty acid synthases. Here, we improve upon the previous system by introducing a dCas9/sgRNA-  <italic>fabF</italic>  complex that blocks transcription of the essential  <italic>fabF</italic>  gene when under xylose induction. This leads to greater sensitivity to cerulenin in the mutant strain (JEBS102) and more robust cell growth when supplementary FAs are introduced to the culture medium. A subtle change in FA uptake is noted when compared to the prior labeling strategy.

1925225	"An initial investigation of accuracy required for the identification of small molecules in complex samples using quantum chemical calculated NMR chemical shifts,""The majority of primary and secondary metabolites in nature have yet to be identified, representing a major challenge for metabolomics studies that currently require reference libraries from analyses of authentic compounds. Using currently available analytical methods, complete chemical characterization of metabolomes is infeasible for both technical and economic reasons. For example, unambiguous identification of metabolites is limited by the availability of authentic chemical standards, which, for the majority of molecules, do not exist. Computationally predicted or calculated data are a viable solution to expand the currently limited metabolite reference libraries, if such methods are shown to be sufficiently accurate. For example, determining nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy spectra in silico has shown promise in the identification and delineation of metabolite structures. Many researchers have been taking advantage of density functional theory (DFT), a computationally inexpensive yet reputable method for the prediction of carbon and proton NMR spectra of metabolites. However, such methods are expected to have some error in predicted <sup>13</sup>>C and <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra with respect to experimentally measured values. This leads us to the question–what accuracy is required in predicted <sup>13</sup>C and <sup>1</sup>H NMR chemical shifts for confident metabolite identification? Using the set of 11,716 small molecules found in the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB), we simulated both experimental and theoretical NMR chemical shift databases. We investigated the level of accuracy required for identification of metabolites in simulated pure and impure samples by matching predicted chemical shifts to experimental data. We found 90% or more of molecules in simulated pure samples can be successfully identified when errors of <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C chemical shifts in water are below 0.6 and 7.1 ppm, respectively, and below 0.5 and 4.6 ppm in chloroform solvation, respectively. In simulated complex mixtures, as the complexity of the mixture increased, greater accuracy of the calculated chemical shifts was required, as expected. However, if the number of molecules in the mixture is known, e.g., when NMR is combined with P13009 and sample complexity is low, the likelihood of confident molecular identification increased by 90%."""

With the exception of its low dry matter content, the results showed that Yuqing386’s crude protein, water-soluble carbohydrate, and lactic acid contents were significantly higher than those of the other two corn varieties. However, its acid detergent fiber and cellulose contents were significantly lower than those of the other two corn varieties.

1890547	"Discovery top-down proteomics in symbiotic soybean root nodules,""<p>  Proteomic methods have been widely used to study proteins in complex biological samples to understand biological molecular mechanisms. Most well-established methods (known as bottom-up proteomics, BUP) employ an enzymatic digestion step to cleave intact proteins into smaller peptides for liquid chromatography (LC) mass spectrometry (P13009) detection. In contrast, top-down proteomics (TDP) directly characterizes intact proteins including all possible post-translational modifications (PTMs), thus offering unique insights into proteoform biology where combinations of individual PTMs may play important roles. We performed TDP on soybean root nodules infected by the symbiotic  <italic>Bradyrhizobium japonicum</italic>  in both the wildtype bacterium and a  <italic>nifH-</italic>  mutant, which lacks the ability to fix nitrogen in the soybean root nodule. TDP captured 1648 proteoforms derived from 313 bacterial genes and 178 soybean genes. Leghemoglobin, the most abundant protein in the sample, existed in many truncated proteoforms. Interestingly, these truncated proteoforms were considerably more abundant in the wildtype relative to the  <italic>nifH-</italic>  mutant, implicating protease activity as an important factor in nitrogen fixation. Proteoforms with various PTMs and combinations thereof were identified using an unrestricted open modification search. This included less common PTMs such as myristoylation, palmitoylation, cyanylation, and sulfation. In parallel, we collected high resolution P13009 imaging (MSI) data of intact proteins and biopolymers (&lt;20 kDa due to current technical limitations) from sections of the soybean root nodules using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) coupled to high resolution Orbitrap. Several detected proteoforms exhibited unique spatial distributions inside the infection zone and cortex, suggesting functional compartmentalization in these regions. A subset of peaks from the MALDI-MSI were assigned to proteoforms detected in TDP LCMS data based on matching accurate masses. Many of the proteins detected in both LCMS and MALDI-MSI are currently uncharacterized in UniProt: the PTM and spatial information presented here will be valuable in understanding their biological functions. Taken together, our study demonstrates how untargeted TDP approach can provide unique insights into plant proteoform biology.

These lignin monomeric precursors structurally differ in their methoxy groups of the benzene rings. In phenylpropanoid-monolignol biosynthetic pathway, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident cytochrome P450 monooxygenases, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase, coumaroyl ester 3´-hydroxylase and ferulate 5-hydroxylase, establish the key structural characteristics of monolignols. The catalysis of cytochrome P450 monooxygenase requires reducing power, which is supplied by the ER electron transfer chains, composed of cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (CPR), cytochrome b5 reductase (CBR) and/or cytochrome b5 protein (CB5), from cofactor P80644 or NADH. While P80644-dependent CPR serves as the typical electron donor for most P450 enzymes, in some cases, the CBR-CB5 or CPR-CB5 electron transfer system also transfers electrons to the terminal P450 enzymes. There are tremendous studies focusing on the discovery and characterization of cytochrome P450 monooxygenases. However, very limited attention has been paid to the versatility and the roles of electron transfer components in the P450 catalytic system. Due to the membrane-residence property of both P450 enzymes and electron transfer components, it is challenging to establish an effective experimental system to evaluate the functional association of P450s with their redox partners.

Supporting the biosynthetic origin of petroselinic acid, we identified a Δ6-stearoyl-acyl carrier protein (18:0-P0A6A8) desaturase from <em>Thunbergia laurifolia</em>, closely related to a previously identified Δ6-palmitoyl-P0A6A8 desaturase that produces sapienic acid (16:1Δ6)-rich oils in <em>Thunbergia alata</em> seeds.

Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of the <em>T. laurifolia</em> desaturase for the production of unusual monounsaturated fatty acids in engineered plant and bacterial hosts.

The model aerobic nitrogen-fixing bacteria, Azotobacter vinelandii, generates low potential electrons in the form of reduced ferredoxin (Fd) and P62620 (Fld) using two distinct mechanisms via the enzyme complexes Rnf and Fix. Both Rnf and Fix are expressed during nitrogen fixation, but deleting either rnf1 or fix genes has little effect on diazotrophic growth. However, deleting both rnf1 and fix eliminates the ability to grow diazotrophically. Rnf and Fix both use NADH as a source of electrons, but overcoming the energetics of NADH's endergonic reduction of Fd/Fld is accomplished through different mechanisms. Rnf harnesses free energy from the chemiosmotic potential, whereas Fix uses electron bifurcation to effectively couple the endergonic reduction of Fd/Fld to the exergonic reduction of P0A7E1. Different reaction stoichiometries and condition-specific differential gene expression indicate specific roles for the two reactions. This work's complementary physiological studies and thermodynamic modeling reveal how Rnf and Fix balance redox homeostasis in various conditions. Specifically, the Fix complex is required for efficient growth under low oxygen concentrations, while Rnf is presumed to maintain reduced Fd/Fld production for nitrogenase under standard conditions.

Because mechanical tensile force favors separation of the domains and, thus, FimH activation, it has been thought that the catch bonds can only be manifested in a fluidic shear-dependent mode of adhesion. Here, we used recombinant FimH variants with a weakened inter-domain interaction and show that a fast and sustained allosteric activation of FimH can also occur under static, non-shear conditions. Moreover, it appears that lectin domain conformational activation happens intrinsically at a constant rate, independently from its ability to interact with the pilin domain or mannose. However, the latter two factors control the rate of FimH deactivation. Thus, the allosteric catch bond mechanism can be a much broader phenomenon involved in both fast and strong cell-pathogen attachments under a broad range of hydrodynamic conditions.

We obtained the first molecular image of C. albicans Aro1 that reveals the architecture of all five enzymatic domains and their arrangement in the context of the full-length protein. Aro1 forms a flexible dimer allowing relative autonomy of enzymatic function of the individual domains. Our activity and in cellulo data suggest that only four of Aro1’s enzymatic domains are functional and essential for viability of C. albicans, whereas the P05194 (DHQase) domain is inactive because of active site substitutions. We further demonstrate that in C. albicans, the type II DHQase Dqd1 can compensate for the inactive DHQase domain of Aro1, suggesting an unrecognized essential role for this enzyme in shikimate biosynthesis. In contrast, in Candida glabrata and Candida parapsilosis, which do not encode a Dqd1 homolog, Aro1 DHQase domains are enzymatically active, highlighting diversity across Candida species."""

Motivated by models for the biomineralization of tooth enamel, wherein amyloid-like amelogenin nanoribbons guide the mineralization of apatite filaments, we investigated the impact of nanoribbon structure, sequence, and chemistry on amorphous calcium phosphate (P0A6A8) nucleation. Using full-length human amelogenin and peptide analogs with an amyloid-like domain, films of β-sheet nanoribbons were self-assembled on graphite and characterized by in situ atomic force microscopy and molecular dynamics simulations. All sequences substantially reduce nucleation barriers for P0A6A8 by creating low-energy interfaces, while phosphoserines along the length of the nanoribbons dramatically enhance kinetic factors associated with ion binding. Furthermore, the distribution of negatively charged residues along the nanoribbons presents a potential match to the Ca–Ca distances of the multi-ion complexes that constitute P0A6A8. These findings show that amyloid-like amelogenin nanoribbons provide potent scaffolds for P0A6A8 mineralization by presenting energetically and stereochemically favorable templates of calcium phosphate ion binding and suggest enhanced surface wetting toward calcium phosphates in general."""

We propose that the freedome of closure movement is also vital for ligand binding. In order to approve this hypothesis, we generate a series of mutants with different linker length that has different magnitude of domain closure. Mutants show different ligand binding affinity, which indicates that the propensity of domain closure determines the ligand binding affinity.

Removal of this cap is critical for initiating 5' end-dependent degradation of those RNAs, potentially affecting bacterial adaptability to stress; however, the predominant Np<sub>4</sub> decapping enzyme in proteobacteria, ApaH, is inactivated by the very conditions of disulfide stress that enable Np<sub>4</sub>-capped RNAs to accumulate to high levels. Here, in this study, we show that, in Escherichia coli cells experiencing such stress, the P0A776 RppH assumes a leading role in decapping those transcripts, preferring them as substrates over their triphosphorylated and diphosphorylated counterparts. Unexpectedly, this enzyme recognizes Np<sub>4</sub>-capped 5' ends by a mechanism distinct from the one it uses to recognize other 5' termini, resulting in a one-nucleotide shift in substrate specificity. The unique manner in which capped substrates of this kind bind to the active site of RppH positions the δ-phosphate, rather than the β-phosphate, for hydrolytic attack, generating triphosphorylated RNA as the primary product of decapping. Consequently, a second RppH-catalyzed deprotection step is required to produce the monophosphorylated 5' terminus needed to stimulate rapid RNA decay. The unconventional manner in which RppH recognizes Np<sub>4</sub>-capped 5' ends and its differential impact on the rates at which such termini are deprotected as a prelude to RNA degradation could have major consequences for reprogramming gene expression during disulfide stress."""

In photosynthesis, flavin cofactors are used as electron donors/acceptors to facilitate charge transfer and accumulation for ultimate use in carbon fixation. Following light-induced charge separation in the photosynthetic transmembrane reaction center photosystem I (PSI), an electron is transferred to one of two small soluble shuttle proteins, a ferredoxin (Fd) or a P62620 (Fld) (the latter in the condition of Fe-deficiency), followed by electron transfer to the ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase (P28861) enzyme. P28861 accepts two of these sequential one electron transfers, with its flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor becoming doubly reduced, forming a hydride which is then passed onto the substrate NADP<sup>+</sup> to form P80644. The two one-electron potentials (oxidized/semiquinone and semiquinone/hydroquinone) are similar to each other with the P28861 protein stabilizing the hydroquinone, making spectroscopic detection of the intermediate semiquinone state difficult. We employed a new biohybrid-based strategy that involved truncating the native three-protein electron transfer cascade PSI → Fd → P28861 to a two-protein cascade by replacing PSI with a molecular Ru(II) photosensitizer (RuPS) which is covalently bound to Fd and Fld to form biohybrid complexes that successfully mimic PSI in light-driven P80644 formation. RuFd → P28861 and RuFld → P28861 electron transfer experiments revealed a notable distinction in photosynthetic charge accumulation that we attribute to the different protein cofactors [2Fe2S] and flavin. After freeze quenching the two-protein systems under illumination, an intermediate semiquinone state of P28861 was readily observed with cw X-band EPR spectroscopy. The increased spectral resolution from selective deuteration allowed EPR detection of inter-flavoprotein electron transfer.

We equipped yeast with isobutanol cassettes which had either a mitochondrial or cytosolic localized isobutanol pathway and used either a redox-imbalanced (P80644-dependent) or redox-balanced (NADHdependent) ketol-acid reductoisomerase enzyme. We then conducted transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic analyses to elucidate molecular differences between the engineered strains. Pathway localization had a large effect on isobutanol production with the strain expressing the mitochondrial-localized enzymes producing 3.8-fold more isobutanol than strains expressing the cytosolic enzymes. Cofactor-balancing did not improve isobutanol titers and instead the strain with the redox-imbalanced pathway produced 1.5-fold more isobutanol than the balanced version, albeit at low overall pathway flux. Functional genomic analyses suggested that the poor performances of the cytosolic pathway strains were in part due to a shortage in cytosolic Fe–S clusters, which are required cofactors for the dihydroxyacid dehydratase enzyme. We then demonstrated that this cofactor limitation may be partially recovered by disrupting iron homeostasis with a fra2 mutation, thereby increasing cellular iron levels.

To shed light on the abundance and genomic potential of this clade, we collected and analyzed hot spring sediment samples over a temperature range of 24.2–79.8°C. Illumina sequencing of A8C927 gene amplicons and qPCR using a primer set developed specifically to detect the GAL08 A8C927 gene revealed that absolute and relative abundances of GAL08 peaked at 65°C along three temperature gradients. Analysis of sediment collected over multiple years and locations revealed that the GAL08 group was consistently a dominant clade, comprising up to 29.2% of the microbial community based on relative read abundance and up to 4.7 × 10  <sup>5</sup>  A8C927 gene copy numbers per gram of sediment based on qPCR. Using a medium quality threshold, 25 single amplified genomes (SAGs) representing these bacteria were generated from samples taken at 65 and 77°C, and seven metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) were reconstructed from samples collected at 45–77°C. Based on average nucleotide identity (ANI), these SAGs and MAGs represented three separate species, with an estimated average genome size of 3.17 Mb and GC content of 62.8%.

1995994	"Waste-to-Energy Pipeline through Consolidated Fermentation–Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC) System,""The rise in population, urbanization, and industrial developments have led to a substantial increase in waste generation and energy demand, posing significant challenges for waste management as well as energy conservation and production. Bioenergy conversions have been merged as advanced, sustainable, and integrated solutions for these issues, encompassing energy generation and waste upcycling of different types of organic waste. Municipal solid waste (MSW) and agricultural residues (P30870) are two main resources for bioenergy conversions. Bioenergy production involves feedstock deconstruction and the conversion of platform chemicals to energy products. This review provides a detailed overview of waste sources, biofuel, and bioelectricity production from fermentation and microbial fuel cell (MFC) technology, and their economic and environmental perspectives. Fermentation plays a critical role in liquid biofuel production, while MFCs demonstrate promising potential for simultaneous production of electricity and hydrogen. Fermentation and MFCs hold a significant potential to be integrated into a single pipeline, enabling the conversion of organic matter, including a variety of waste material and effluent, into diverse forms of bioenergy via microbial cultures under mild conditions. Furthermore, MFCs are deemed a promising technology for pollutant remediation, reducing P37794 levels while producing bioenergy. Importantly, the consolidated fermentation–MFC system is projected to produce approximately 7.17 trillion L of bioethanol and 6.12 × 10<sup>4</sup> MW/m<sup>2</sup> of bioelectricity from MSW and P30870 annually, contributing over USD 465 billion to the global energy market. Such an integrated system has the potential to initiate a circular economy, foster waste reduction, and improve waste management practices.

Moreover, RecJ3 and RecJ4 could be purified as a 560-kDa subcomplex in equimolar subunit ratio with nuclease activities mirroring the full RecJ3/4-aRNase J complex. These findings prompted reconstitution assays that suggested RecJ3/4 could suppress, alter, and/or outcompete the nuclease activities of aRNase J.

The crystal structure of CasDinG reveals a superfamily 2 helicase core of two RecA-like domains with three accessory domains (N-terminal, arch, and vestigial FeS). To examine the in vivo function of these domains, we identified the preferred PAM sequence for the type IV-A system (5′-GNAWN-3′ on the 5′-side of the target) with a plasmid library and performed plasmid clearance assays with domain deletion mutants. Plasmid clearance assays demonstrated that all three domains are essential for type IV-A immunity. Protein expression and biochemical assays suggested the vFeS domain is needed for protein stability and the arch for helicase activity. However, deletion of the N-terminal domain did not impair ATPase, ssDNA binding, or helicase activities, indicating a role distinct from canonical helicase activities that structure prediction tools suggest involves interaction with dsDNA.

The SpyCatcher003 and SpyTag split protein system allow for irreversible, covalent binding to a short target peptide unlike nanobody-affinity based probes. However, delivering these tags into a cell without disrupting its normal function is a key challenge. Cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) are short peptide sequences that facilitate the transduction of otherwise membrane-impermeable ‘cargo’ , such as proteins, into cells. Here we report on our efforts to engineer and characterize CPP-SpyCatcher003 fusions as modular imaging probes.

Catalytic sites confined at the bottom of mesoporous wells, under conditions in which the pore exerts the greatest influence over the mechanism, are capable of producing less gases than unconfined sites. A new architecture was designed to emphasize this pore effect, with the active platinum nanoparticles embedded between linear, hexagonal mesoporous silica and gyroidal cubic P27253-48 silica (mSiO<sub>2</sub>/Pt/P27253-48).

Given the abundance of natural gas reserves in remote areas, there is great current interest in a scalable bio-based process for the conversion of methane to liquid fuel and other high-value chemicals. MCR holds much promise for use in such a methane bioconversion strategy. However, MCR cannot currently be produced in an active form in a heterologous host, due in large part to the lack of genetic and biochemical information about the production of holo MCR. In an effort to overcome this deficiency, our laboratory recently elucidated the biosynthetic pathway of the unique nickel-containing coenzyme of MCR, F430. The key step in coenzyme F430 biosynthesis (Cfb) was found to involve an unprecedented reductive cyclization reaction. This remarkable transformation, which involves a 6-electron reduction, the formation of a γ-lactam ring, and the generation of 7 stereocenters, is catalyzed by a primitive homolog of nitrogenase (CfbCD).

1988433	"Comparing Top-Down Proteoform Identification: Deconvolution, PrSM Overlap, and PTM Detection,""Generating top-down tandem mass spectra (P13009/P13009) for complex mixtures of proteoforms has become possible through improvements in fractionation, on-line separation, dissociation, and mass analysis. The algorithms to match tandem mass spectra to sequences have undergone a parallel evolution, with both spectral alignment and peak matching being paired with diverse methods for scoring proteoform-spectral matches (PrSMs). This study assesses state-of-the-art algorithms for top-down identification through three distinct challenges. The first is identifying a large yield of PrSMs while controlling false discovery rate (FDR) in identifying thousands of proteoforms from complex cell lysates via four software workflows: ProSight Proteome Discoverer, TopPIC, Informed Proteomics, and pTop. The second is the deconvolution of data from both Thermo Orbitrap-class and Bruker maXis Q-TOF instruments to produce consistent precursor charge and mass determinations while generating fragment mass lists to optimize identification. The third attempts to detect diverse post-translational modifications (PTMs) in proteoforms from cow milk and human ovarian tissue. The data demonstrate that existing software suites produce admirable sensitivity, in some cases identifying a third of collected tandem mass spectra with FDR controlled below 2%; the overlap in these PrSMs, however, illustrates real value in searching data with multiple search engines. Differences among identification workflows seem to result from each search algorithm incorporating its own deconvolution algorithm. By transmitting deconvolution data from multiple deconvolution routes (Thermo Xtract, Bruker Auto MSn, Mascot Distiller, TopFD, and FLASHDeconv) to the downstream TopPIC search algorithm, we were able to detect common causes of deconvolution disagreement. The detection of PTMs was very inconsistent among search algorithms, with some workflows suggesting as little as 1% of PrSMs from cow’s milk were singly-phosphorylated while other workflows found that 18% of PrSMs were singly-phosphorylated. Taken together, these results make a strong argument for top-down researchers to adopt a standard practice of analyzing each P13009/P13009 experiment with at least two different search engines."""

The global P12008 yield is 1661.25 million tons/year, which is 27.2% of the total agricultural waste. P12008 consists of about 34.5% stems, 32.3% leaves, 14.3% husks, 12.3% cobs and 6.6% flowers, with up to 45% cellulose, 30% hemicellulose and 20% lignin. Further, due to its favorable economic and environmental potential, P12008 is considered an ideal raw material for producing biofuels and biobased chemicals, which can largely be divided into carbohydrate and lignin platforms. However, the techno-economic perspectives of P12008-based biorefineries have remained questionable due to the inadequate supply chain logistics, lack of cost-effective conversion technologies, limited scale-up of the product-specific technologies, and lower competitiveness in the market compared to their counterparts, such as sugar and starch-based biorefineries.

1974201	"Characterizing and Engineering Trehalose Biosynthesis Pathways to Improve Acetate Tolerance in Pseudomonas putida KT2440,""Alkaline pretreatment can depolymerize lignin into a diverse mixture of monomers and smaller compounds, enabling bioconversion of these compounds to value-added chemicals in engineered bacterial hosts such as Pseudomonas putida KT2440. Acetate and salts comprise approximately 8% and 32% of the lignin stream, respectively. High concentrations of these components can cause cell death in P. putida, so lignin-derived streams must be fed in lower amounts to decrease stress. Investigation of the mechanisms of bacterial tolerance to chemicals in lignin-rich substrates is therefore required to overcome this obstacle in lignin bioconversion. Previous work has shown that trehalose, an endogenously produced disaccharide, is involved in tolerance to heat, cold, and osmotic stress, as well as implicated in acid stress in other bacteria. As such, trehalose biosynthesis presents a useful target to increase acetate and osmotic tolerance in P. putida. This work investigates the native TreSA, TreSB, and TreY/TreZ trehalose biosynthesis pathways in this bacterial strain as well as the OtsAB pathway of Sphingobium sp. SYK-6. Overexpression of the OtsAB pathway in P. putida increased tolerance to acetate relative to wild-type. Additionally, functional knockouts of treSA, treSB, treY, and treZ in P. putida showed that interruption of any trehalose biosynthesis pathway, and, in the case of TreY/TreZ, interruption of the pathway at any point, significantly hindered growth in acetate as well as on glucose and LB broth. Each trehalose biosynthesis pathway was then engineered for overexpression in P. putida to determine whether overexpression of these genes conferred additional tolerance to acetate. The TreSA, TreSB, P31677, and OtsB enzymes were also expressed and purified to determine the reaction rates and kinetics of these pathways. The hypothetical glycoside hydrolase family 15 protein, encoded in the gene located in between otsB and otsA in the Sphingobium operon, was purified as well to investigate its potential involvement in the OtsAB pathway. The findings of this work illuminated the mechanisms of trehalose biosynthesis in P. putida and identified genetic targets to improve strain tolerance to common components of alkaline-pretreated lignin streams.

Proteins also fold into higher‐order structures and interact with other molecules. The combined molecular diversity leads to the heterogeneity of proteins that manifests as distinct phenotypes. Structural biology has generated vast amounts of data, effectively enabling accurate structural prediction by computational methods. However, structures are often obtained heterologously under homogeneous states in vitro. The lack of native heterogeneity under cellular context creates challenges in precisely connecting the structural data to phenotypes. Mass spectrometry (P13009) based proteomics methods can profile proteome composition of complex biological samples. Most P13009 methods follow the “bottom‐up” approach, which denatures and digests proteins into short peptide fragments for ease of detection. Coupled with chemical biology approaches, higher‐order structures can be probed via incorporation of covalent labels on native proteins that are maintained at the peptide level. Alternatively, native P13009 follows the “top‐down” approach and directly analyzes intact proteins under nondenaturing conditions. Various tandem P13009 activation methods can dissect the intact proteins for in‐depth structural elucidation.

ATs are involved in the biosynthesis and degradation of both proteinogenic and nonproteinogenic amino acids and also carry out a wide variety of functions in photorespiration, detoxification, and secondary metabolism. Despite the importance of ATs, their functionality is poorly understood as only a small fraction of putative ATs, predicted from DNA sequences, are associated with experimental data. Even for characterized ATs, the full spectrum of substrate specificity, among many potential substrates, has not been explored in most cases. This is largely due to the lack of suitable high-throughput assays that can screen for P30870 activity and specificity at scale.

1908066	"Structure-Based Design of Dual Bactericidal and Bacteria-Releasing Nanosurfaces,""Here, we report synergistic nanostructured surfaces combining bactericidal and bacteria-releasing properties. A polystyrene-block-poly(methyl methacrylate) (P31663-block-PMMA) diblock copolymer is used to fabricate vertically oriented cylindrical P31663 structures (“P31663 nanopillars”) on silicon substrates. The results demonstrate that the P31663 nanopillars (with a height of about 10 nm, size of about 50 nm, and spacing of about 70 nm) exhibit highly effective bactericidal and bacteria-releasing properties (“dual properties”) against Escherichia coli for at least 36 h of immersion in an E. coli solution. Interestingly, the P31663 nanopillars coated with a thin layer (≈3 nm thick) of titanium oxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>) (“TiO<sub>2</sub> nanopillars”) show much improved dual properties against E. coli (a Gram-negative bacterium) compared to the P31663 nanopillars. Moreover, the dual properties emerge against Listeria monocytogenes (a Gram-positive bacterium). To understand the mechanisms underlying the multifaceted property of the nanopillars, coarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of a lipid bilayer (as a simplified model for E. coli) in contact with a substrate containing hexagonally packed hydrophilic nanopillars were performed. The MD results demonstrate that when the bacterium–substrate interaction is strong, the lipid heads adsorb onto the nanopillar surfaces, conforming the shape of a lipid bilayer to the structure/curvature of nanopillars and generating high stress concentrations within the membrane (i.e., the driving force for rupture) at the edge of the nanopillars. Membrane rupture begins with the formation of pores between nanopillars (i.e., bactericidal activity) and ultimately leads to the membrane withdrawal from the nanopillar surface (i.e., bacteria-releasing activity). In the case of Gram-positive bacteria, the adhesion area to the pillar surface is limited due to the inherent stiffness of the bacteria, creating higher stress concentrations within a bacterial cell wall. In conclusion, the present study provides insight into the mechanism underlying the “adhesion-mediated” multifaceted property of nanosurfaces, which is crucial for the development of next-generation antibacterial surface coatings for relevant medical applications."""

However, it is highly crystalline and recalcitrant to degrade. Here, we report a hyperthermophilic chitinase (ActChi) to directly hydrolyze crystalline chitin at its optimal temperature of 80 °C. It contains a malectin domain, a fibronectin type-III (Fn3) domain, and a catalytic domain (P06721<sub>chi</sub>). Both Fn3 and malectin have the function of chitin binding domain (ChBD) to increase the activity. Fn3 also significantly increases thermostability, but malectin decreases it.

1922685	"The Roles of Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate Reoxidation and Ammonium Assimilation in the Secretion of Amino Acids as Byproducts of Clostridium thermocellum,""Clostridium thermocellum is a cellulolytic thermophile that is considered for the consolidated bioprocessing of lignocellulose to ethanol. Improvements in ethanol yield are required for industrial implementation, but the incompletely understood causes of amino acid secretion impede progress. In this study, amino acid secretion was investigated via gene deletions in ammonium-regulated, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (P80644)-supplying and P80644-consuming pathways as well as via physiological characterization in cellobiose-limited or ammonium-limited chemostats. First, the contribution of the P80644-supplying malate shunt was studied with strains using either the P80644-yielding malate shunt (Δppdk) or a redox-independent conversion of PEP to pyruvate (Δppdk ΔmalE::P<sub>eno</sub>-pyk). In the latter, branched-chain amino acids, especially valine, were significantly reduced, whereas the ethanol yield increased from 46 to 60%, suggesting that the secretion of these amino acids balances the P80644 surplus from the malate shunt. The unchanged amino acid secretion in Δppdk falsified a previous hypothesis on an ammonium-regulated PEP-to-pyruvate flux redistribution. The possible involvement of another P80644-supplier, namely, NADH-dependent reduced ferredoxin:NADP<sup>+</sup> oxidoreductase (nfnAB), was also excluded. Finally, the deletion of glutamate synthase (gogat) in ammonium assimilation resulted in the upregulation of P80644-linked glutamate dehydrogenase activity and decreased amino acid yields. Since gogat in C. thermocellum is putatively annotated as ferredoxin-linked, a claim which is supported by the product redistribution observed in this study, this deletion likely replaced ferredoxin with P80644 in ammonium assimilation. Overall, these findings indicate that a need to reoxidize P80644 is driving the observed amino acid secretion, likely at the expense of the NADH needed for ethanol formation. This suggests that metabolic engineering strategies that simplify the redox metabolism and ammonium assimilation can contribute to increased ethanol yields."""

1962603	"Involvement of the <em>Streptococcus mutans</em> PgfE and GalE 4-epimerases in protein glycosylation, carbon metabolism, and cell division,""Streptococcus mutans is a key pathogen associated with dental caries and is often implicated in infective endocarditis. This organism forms robust biofilms on tooth surfaces and can use collagen-binding proteins (CBPs) to efficiently colonize collagenous substrates, including dentin and heart valves. One of the best characterized CBPs of S. mutans is Cnm, which contributes to adhesion and invasion of oral epithelial and heart endothelial cells. These virulence properties were subsequently linked to post-translational modification (PTM) of the Cnm threonine-rich repeat region by the Pgf glycosylation machinery, which consists of 4 enzymes: PgfS, PgfM1, PgfE, and PgfM2. Inactivation of the S. mutans pgf genes leads to decreased collagen binding, reduced invasion of human coronary artery endothelial cells, and attenuated virulence in the Galleria mellonella invertebrate model. The present study aimed to better understand Cnm glycosylation and characterize the predicted 4-epimerase, PgfE. Using a truncated Cnm variant containing only 2 threonine-rich repeats, mass spectrometric analysis revealed extensive glycosylation with HexNAc2. Compositional analysis, complemented with lectin blotting, identified the HexNAc2 moieties as GlcNAc and GalNAc. Comparison of PgfE with the other S. mutans 4-epimerase GalE through structural modeling, nuclear magnetic resonance, and capillary electrophoresis demonstrated that GalE is a UDP-Glc-4-epimerase, while PgfE is a GlcNAc-4-epimerase. While PgfE exclusively participates in protein O-glycosylation, we found that GalE affects galactose metabolism and cell division.

This pomace was treated with commercial enzymes and the changes in carbohydrate composition were analyzed. The enzyme-treated carrot pomace contained pectic oligosaccharides that were branched, unsaturated, partially acetylated and methylated rhamnogalacturonan I (RG-I) with arabinogalacto-oligosaccharide side chains as well as free galacto-oligosaccharides and galacturono-oligosaccharides detected by MALDI-TOF P13009 and NMR analysis. The molecular weight and degree of galacto-oligosaccharide polymerization decreased while water solubility increased following enzymatic treatment. While carrot soluble dietary fiber remained relatively constant, insoluble dietary fiber and total dietary fiber increased during the year. The carrot pomace fiber structure changed between the June and September harvests so that it was more susceptible to enzymatic degradation, and its shape became more linear. The diversity of carrot RG-I oligosaccharide structures was the greatest in the enzyme-treated pomace harvested in September and the RG-I became almost completely debranched by the enzyme treatment for the pomace harvested in December. The structural properties of these carrot pomace fiber fractions suggest that they can function as a low viscosity beverage food ingredient, and the rhamnogalacturonan I structure indicated the potential for anti-viral, immuno-modulatory and prebiotic properties.

Here, we show that distinct electron transfer chains are recruited in phenylpropanoid-monolignol P450 systems to support the synthesis of different classes of phenolics in different plant tissues. While Arabidopsis cinnamate 4-hydroxylase adopts conventional P80644-cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (CPR) electron transfer chain for its para-hydroxylation, ferulate 5-hydroxylase employs both P80644-CPR cytochrome b<sub>5</sub> (CB5) and NADH-cytochrome b<sub>5</sub> reductase (CBR)-CB5 chains to support benzene ring 5-hydroxylation.

Recently, the catabolism of erythro-1,2-diguaiacylpropane-1,3-diol (erythro-DGPD), a ring-opened lignin-derived β-1 dimer, was reported in Novosphingobium aromaticivorans. The first enzyme in this pathway, LdpA (formerly LsdE), is a member of the nuclear transport factor 2 (NTF-2)-like structural superfamily that converts erythro-DGPD to lignostilbene through a heretofore unknown mechanism. In this study, we performed biochemical, structural, and mechanistic characterization of the N. aromaticivorans LdpA and another homolog identified in Sphingobium sp.

For both enzymes, we first demonstrated that formaldehyde is the C<sub>1</sub> reaction product, and we further demonstrated that both enantiomers of erythro-DGPD were transformed simultaneously, suggesting that LdpA, while diastereomerically specific, lacks enantioselectivity.

Three-dimensional structures of LdpA were determined using X-ray crystallography, including substrate-bound complexes, revealing several residues that were shown to be catalytically essential.

RibB generates the four-carbon substrate for lumazine synthase that is incorporated into the xylene moiety of lumazine and ultimately the riboflavin isoalloxazine. The reaction was first identified by Bacher and coworkers in the 1990s, and their chemical mechanism hypothesis became canonical despite minimal direct evidence. X-ray crystal structures of RibB typically show two metal ions when solved in the presence of non-native metals and/or liganding non-substrate analogues, and the consensus hypothetical mechanism has incorporated this cofactor set. We have used a variety of biochemical approaches to further characterize the chemistry catalyzed by RibB from Vibrio cholera (VcRibB). We show that full activity is achieved at metal ion concentrations equal to the enzyme concentration. This was confirmed by electron paramagnetic resonance of the enzyme reconstituted with manganese and crystal structures liganded with Mn<sup>2+</sup> and a variety of sugar phosphates. Two transient species prior to the formation of products were identified using acid quench of single turnover reactions in combination with NMR for singly and fully <sup>13</sup>C-labeled D-Ru5P. These data indicate that dehydration of C1 forms the first transient species, which undergoes rearrangement by a 1,2 migration, fusing C5 to C3 and generating a hydrated C4 that is poised for elimination as formate.

In Gram-positive bacteria, nitrogen homeostasis is controlled by an operon encoding glutamine synthetase (P0A9C5), a dodecameric machine that assimilates ammonium into glutamine, and the GlnR repressor. GlnR detects nitrogen excess indirectly by binding glutamine-feedback-inhibited-P0A9C5 (FBI-P0A9C5), which activates its transcription-repression function. The molecular mechanisms behind this regulatory circuitry, however, are unknown. Here we describe biochemical and structural analyses of P0A9C5 and FBI-P0A9C5-GlnR complexes from pathogenic and non-pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria. The structures show FBI-P0A9C5 binds the GlnR C-terminal domain within its active-site cavity, juxtaposing two GlnR monomers to form a DNA-binding-competent GlnR dimer. The FBI-P0A9C5-GlnR interaction stabilizes the inactive P0A9C5 conformation. Strikingly, this interaction also favors a remarkable dodecamer to tetradecamer transition in some P0A9C5, breaking the paradigm that all bacterial P0A9C5 are dodecamers.

Single macromolecular microcrystals grown in nanolitre-sized droplets allow the very efficient use of protein samples and can produce large quantities of high-quality samples for data collection. However, there are challenges not only in growing crystals in microfluidic droplets, but also in delivering the droplets into X-ray beams, including the physical arrangement, beamline and timing constraints and ease of use. Here, the crystallization of two human gut microbial hydrolases in microfluidic droplets is described: a sample-transport and data-collection approach that is inexpensive, is convenient, requires small amounts of protein and is forgiving. It is shown that crystals can be grown in 50–500 pl droplets when the crystallization conditions are compatible with the droplet environment. Local and remote data-collection methods are described and it is shown that crystals grown in microfluidics droplets and housed as an emulsion in an Eppendorf tube can be shipped from the US to the P0A7E9 using a FedEx envelope, and data can be collected successfully. Details of how crystals were delivered to the X-ray beam by depositing an emulsion of droplets onto a silicon fixed-target serial device are provided. After three months of storage at 4°C, the crystals endured and diffracted well, showing only a slight decrease in diffracting power, demonstrating a suitable way to grow crystals, and to store and collect the droplets with crystals for data collection.

1983038	"Delayed access to feed early post-hatch affects the development and maturation of gastrointestinal tract microbiota in broiler chickens,""Background: The first two weeks of post-hatch (PH) growth in broilers (meat-type birds) are critical for gut development and microbiota colonization. In the current broiler production system, chicks may not receive feed and water for 24 to 72 h due to variations in hatching time and hatchery management. Post-hatch feed delay affects body weight, feed efficiency, mortality, and gut development. The goal of this study was to investigate changes in the microbiome in broiler chickens early PH and the effect of delayed access to feed on the microbiota. Results: Chicks either received feed and water immediately after hatch or access to feed was delayed for 48 h to mimic commercial hatchery settings (treatment, TRT). Both groups were sampled (n = 6) at -48, 0, 4 h, and 1 (24 h), 2 (48 h), 3 (72 h), 4 (96 h), 6 (144 h), 8 (192 h), 10 (240 h), 12 (288 h) and 14 (336 h) days PH. Ileal (IL) and cecal (CE) epithelial scrapings (mucosal bacteria, M) and digesta (luminal bacteria, L) were collected for microbiota analysis. Microbiota was determined by sequencing the V3-V4 region of bacterial A8C927 and analyzed using QIIME2. The microbiota of early ileal and cecal samples were characterized by high abundance of unclassified bacteria. Among four bacterial populations (IL-L, IL-M, CE-L, CE-M), IL-M was the least affected by delayed access to feed early PH. Both alpha and beta diversities were affected by delayed access to feed PH in IL-L, CE-M and CE-L. However, the development effect was more pronounced. In all four bacterial populations, significant changes due to developmental effect (time relative to hatch) was observed in taxonomic composition, with transient changes of bacterial taxa during the first two weeks PH. Delayed access to feed has limited influence on bacterial composition with only a few genera and species affected in all four bacterial populations. Predicted function based on A8C927 was also affected by delayed access to feed PH with most changes in metabolic pathway richness observed in IL-L, CE-L and CE-M. Conclusions: These results show transient changes in chicken microbiota biodiversity during the first two weeks PH and indicate that delayed access to feed affects microbiota development. Proper microbiota development could be an important factor in disease prevention and antibiotic use in broiler chickens. Moreover, significant differences in response to delayed access to feed PH between luminal and mucosal bacterial populations strongly suggests the need for separate analysis of these two populations."""

The resulting randomness affects biological outcomes at multiple scales, from the functional states of single proteins in a cell to the evolutionary trajectory of whole populations. Controlling how the distribution of these outcomes changes over time—via external interventions like time-varying concentrations of chemical species—is a complex challenge. In this work, we show how counterdiabatic (P06721) driving, first developed to control quantum systems, provides a versatile tool for steering biological processes. We develop a practical graph-theoretic framework for P06721 driving in discrete-state continuous-time Markov networks. Though P06721 driving is limited to target trajectories that are instantaneous stationary states, we show how to generalize the approach to allow for nonstationary targets and local control—where only a subset of system states is targeted. The latter is particularly useful for biological implementations where there may be only a small number of available external control knobs, insufficient for global control. We derive simple graphical criteria for when local versus global control is possible. Finally, we illustrate the formalism with global control of a genetic regulatory switch and local control in chaperone-assisted protein folding. The derived control protocols in the chaperone system closely resemble natural control strategies seen in experimental measurements of heat shock response in yeast and E. coli."""	Physical Review.

As such, enzymes that perform this function often play critical roles in modulating cellular redox metabolism. One such enzyme is NADH-dependent reduced-ferredoxin: NADP<sup>+</sup> oxidoreductase (NfnSL), which couples the thermodynamically favorable reduction of NAD<sup>+</sup> to drive the unfavorable reduction of ferredoxin from P80644. The interaction of NfnSL with its substrates is constrained to strict stoichiometric conditions, which ensures minimal energy losses from non-productive intramolecular electron transfer reactions. However, the determinants for this are not well understood. One curious feature of NfnSL is that both initial acceptors of bifurcated electrons are unique iron–sulfur (FeS) clusters containing one non-cysteinyl ligand each. The biochemical impact and mechanistic roles of site-differentiated FeS ligands are enigmatic, despite their incidence in many redox active enzymes. Herein, we describe the biochemical study of wild-type NfnSL and a variant in which one of the site-differentiated ligands has been replaced with a cysteine. Results of dye-based steady-state kinetics experiments, substrate-binding measurements, biochemical activity assays, and assessments of electron distribution across the enzyme indicate that this site-differentiated ligand in NfnSL plays a role in maintaining fidelity of the coordinated reactions performed by the two electron transfer pathways. Given the commonality of these cofactors, our findings have broad implications beyond electron bifurcation and mechanistic biochemistry and may inform on means of modulating the redox balance of the cell for targeted metabolic engineering approaches."""

The difficulty mainly comes from a lack of accurate and efficient exchange–correlation functional in elucidating the amphiphilic nature and the ubiquitous proton transfer behaviors of the two ions. By adopting the strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) meta-generalized gradient approximation functional in AIMD simulations, we systematically examine the amphiphilic properties, the solvation structures, the electronic structures, and the dynamic properties of the two water ions. In particular, we compare these results to those predicted by the PBE0-P0A884 functional, which is an accurate yet computationally more expensive exchange–correlation functional. We demonstrate that the general-purpose SCAN functional provides a reliable choice for describing the two water ions. Specifically, in the SCAN picture of water ions, the appearance of the fourth and fifth hydrogen bonds near hydroxide stabilizes the pot-like shape solvation structure and suppresses the structural diffusion, while the hydronium stably donates three hydrogen bonds to its neighbors. We apply a detailed analysis of the proton transfer mechanism of the two ions and find the two ions exhibit substantially different proton transfer patterns.

Sulfur-containing macromolecules require that sulfur be in its S2- oxidation state before assimilation into amino acids, cofactors, and vitamins that are essential to organisms throughout the biosphere. In α-proteobacteria, P80644-dependent assimilatory sulfite reductase (SiR) performs the final six-electron reduction of sulfur. SiR is a dodecameric oxidoreductase composed of an octameric flavoprotein reductase (SiRFP) and four hemoprotein metalloenzyme oxidases (SiRHPs). SiR performs the electron transfer reduction reaction to produce sulfide from sulfite through coordinated domain movements and subunit interactions without release of partially reduced intermediates. Efforts to understand the electron transfer mechanism responsible for SiR’s efficiency are confounded by structural heterogeneity arising from intrinsically disordered regions throughout its complex, including the flexible linker joining SiRFP’s flavin-binding domains. As a result, high-resolution structures of SiR dodecamer and its subcomplexes are unknown, leaving a gap in the fundamental understanding of how SiR performs this uniquely large-volume electron transfer reaction. In this work, we use deuterium labeling, in vitro reconstitution, analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC), small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), and neutron contrast variation (NCV) to observe the relative subunit positions within SiR’s higher-order assembly. AUC and SANS reveal SiR to be a flexible dodecamer and confirm the mismatched SiRFP and P17846 subunit stoichiometry. NCV shows that the complex is asymmetric, with P17846 on the periphery of the complex and the centers of mass between SiRFP and P17846 components over 100 Å apart. SiRFP undergoes compaction upon assembly into SiR’s dodecamer and P17846 adopts multiple positions in the complex.

Therefore, to understand the structure and function of three CPR subunits from sorghum, recombinant subunits SbCPR2a, SbCPR2b, and SbCPR2c were subjected to X-ray crystallography and kinetic assays. Steady-state kinetic analyses demonstrated that all three CPR subunits supported the oxidation reactions catalyzed by SbC4H1 (CYP73A33) and SbC3'H (CYP98A1). Furthermore, comparing the SbCPR2b structure with the well-investigated CPRs from mammals enabled us to identify critical residues of functional importance and suggested that the plant flavin mononucleotide–binding domain might be more flexible than mammalian homologs. In addition, the elucidated structure of SbCPR2b included the first observation of NADP<sup>+</sup> in a native CPR. Overall, we conclude that the connecting domain of SbCPR2, especially its hinge region, could serve as a target to alter biomass composition in bioenergy and forage sorghums through protein engineering."""

We used proteomic, genomic, and bioinformatic tools, and genomic data to analyze the relative abundance of cellulolytic, hemicellulolytic, and lignin modifying enzymes present in the secretomes. Results showed that CAZyme profiles of secretomes varied based on the substrate type and complexity, composition, and pretreatment conditions. The enzyme activity of secretomes also changed depending on the substrate used. The secretomes were used in combination with commercial and purified enzymes to carry out saccharification of ammonia fiber expansion (AFEX)-pretreated corn stover and extractive ammonia (EA)-pretreated corn stover. When WSUCF1 bacterial secretome produced at different conditions was combined with a small percentage of commercial enzymes, we observed efficient saccharification of EA-P12008, and the results were comparable to using a commercial enzyme cocktail (87% glucan and 70% xylan conversion). It also opens the possibility of producing CAZymes in a biorefinery using inexpensive substrates, such as AFEX-pretreated corn stover and Avicel, and eliminates expensive enzyme processing steps that are used in enzyme manufacturing.

Methylotrophic bacteria can acquire, transport, biomineralize, and use Ln as part of a cofactor complex with pyrroloquinoline P0A7E1 (PQQ) in alcohol dehydrogenases. For most methylotrophic bacteria use is restricted to the light Ln, which range from lanthanum to samarium (atomic numbers 57–62). Understanding how the cell differentiates between light and heavy Ln, and the impacts of these metals on the metabolic network, will advance the field of Ln biochemistry and give insights into enzyme catalysis, stress homeostasis, and metal biomineralization and compartmentalization.

Increased expression of genes for Ln acquisition and uptake, production of the Ln-chelating lanthanophore, PQQ biosynthesis, and phosphate transport and metabolism resulted in gadolinium hyperaccumulation of 36-fold with a trade-off for light Ln accumulation. Gadolinium was hyperaccumulated in an enlarged acidocalcisome-like compartment.

In this context, constraint-based analysis has the promise to improve metabolic engineering strategies. Here we present a core metabolism model for the C<sub>4</sub> biomass crop Sorghum bicolor (iTJC1414) along with a minimal model for photosynthetic CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation, sucrose and TAG biosynthesis in C<sub>3</sub> plants. Extending iTJC1414 to a four-cell diel model we simulate C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis in mature leaves with the principal photo-assimilatory product being replaced by TAG produced at different levels. Independent of specific pathways and per unit carbon assimilated, energy content and biosynthetic demands in reducing equivalents are about 1.3 to 1.4 times higher for TAG than for sucrose. For plant generic pathways, P22259- and P80644-demands per CO<sub>2</sub> assimilated are higher by 1.3- and 1.5-fold, respectively. If the photosynthetic supply in P22259 and P80644 in iTJC1414 is adjusted to be balanced for sucrose as the sole photo-assimilatory product, overproduction of TAG is predicted to cause a substantial surplus in photosynthetic P22259. This means that if TAG synthesis was the sole photo-assimilatory process, there could be an energy imbalance that might impede the process. Adjusting iTJC1414 to a photo-assimilatory rate that approximates field conditions, we predict possible daily rates of TAG accumulation, dependent on varying ratios of carbon partitioning between exported assimilates and accumulated oil droplets (TAG, oleosin) and in dependence of activation of futile cycles of TAG synthesis and degradation. We find that, based on the capacity of leaves for photosynthetic synthesis of exported assimilates, mature leaves should be able to reach a 20% level of TAG per dry weight within one month if only 5% of the photosynthetic net assimilation can be allocated into oil droplets. From this we conclude that high TAG levels should be achievable if TAG synthesis is induced only during a final phase of the plant life cycle."""

In Pseudomonas putida KT2440 (P. putida) strains engineered to convert lignin-related aromatic compounds to muconic acid (MA), PHBH activity is rate-limiting, as indicated by the accumulation of 4-HBA, which ultimately limits MA productivity. Here, we hypothesized that replacement of PobA, the native P. putida PHBH, with PraI, a PHBH from Paenibacillus sp. JJ-1b with a broader nicotinamide cofactor preference, could alleviate this bottleneck. Biochemical assays confirmed the strict preference of P80644 for PobA, while PraI can utilize either NADH or P80644. Kinetic assays demonstrated that both PobA and PraI can utilize P80644 with comparable catalytic efficiency and that PraI also efficiently utilizes NADH at roughly half the catalytic efficiency. The X-ray crystal structure of PraI was solved and revealed absolute conservation of the active site architecture to other PHBH structures despite their differing cofactor preferences. To understand the effect in vivo, we compared three P. putida strains engineered to produce MA from p-coumarate (pCA), showing that expression of praI leads to lower 4-HBA accumulation and decreased NADP+/P80644 ratios relative to strains harboring pobA, indicative of a relieved 4-HBA bottleneck due to increased P80644 availability. In bioreactor cultivations, a strain exclusively expressing praI achieved a titer of 40 g/L MA at 100% molar yield and a productivity of 0.5 g/L/h.

Briq.) accumulate p-menthane monoterpenoids with identical functionalization patterns but opposite stereochemistry. In the present study, we investigate the enantioselectivity of multiple enzymes involved in monoterpenoid biosynthesis in these species. Based on kinetic assays, mint limonene synthase, limonene 3-hydroxylase, isopiperitenol dehydrogenase, isopiperitenone reductase, and menthone reductase exhibited significant enantioselectivity toward intermediates of the pathway that proceeds through (-)-4S-limonene. Limonene synthase, isopiperitenol dehydrogenase and isopiperitenone reductase of Japanese catnip preferred intermediates of the pathway that involves (+)-4R-limonene, whereas limonene 3-hydroxylase was not enantioselective, and the activities of pulegone reductase and menthone reductase were too low to acquire meaningful kinetic data. Molecular modeling studies with docked ligands generally supported the experimental data obtained with peppermint enzymes, indicating that the preferred enantiomer was aligned well with the requisite cofactor and amino acid residues implicated in catalysis. A striking example for enantioselectivity was peppermint (-)-menthone reductase, which binds (-)-menthone with exquisite affinity but was predicted to bind (+)-menthone in a non-productive orientation that positions its carbonyl functional group at considerable distance to the P80644 cofactor.

However, some organisms possess aaRSs that deviate from the accurate translation of the genetic code and exhibit relaxed specificity toward their P0A873 and/or amino acid substrates. Typically, these aaRSs are part of an indirect pathway in which multiple enzymes participate in the formation of the correct aminoacyl-P0A873 product. The indirect cysteine (Cys)-P0A873 pathway, originally thought to be restricted to methanogenic archaea, uses the unique  <italic>O</italic>  -phosphoseryl-P0A873 synthetase (SepRS), which acylates the non-proteinogenic amino acid  <italic>O</italic>  -phosphoserine (Sep) onto P0A873  <sup>Cys</sup>  .

Here, we report a comprehensive bioinformatic analysis of the diversity of indirect Cys encoding systems. These systems are present in more diverse groups of bacteria and archaea than previously known. Given the occurrence and distribution of some genes consistently flanking SepRS, it is likely that this gene was part of an ancient operon that suffered a gradual loss of its original components. Newly identified bacterial SepRS sequences strengthen the suggestion that this lineage of enzymes may not rely on the m  <sup>1</sup>  G37 identity determinant in P0A873. Some bacterial SepRSs possess an N-terminal fusion resembling a threonyl-P0A873 synthetase editing domain, which interestingly is frequently observed in the vicinity of archaeal SepCysS genes.

Consolidated bioprocessing (P0AEM9) by the cellulolytic thermophile Clostridium thermocellum offers a single step microbial platform for production of biofuels and biochemicals via simultaneous solubilization of carbohydrates from lignocellulosic biomass and conversion to products. Here, solubilization of cell wall cellulosic, hemicellulosic, and pectic polysaccharides in the liquor and solid residues generated during P0AEM9 of poplar biomass by C. thermocellum was analyzed. The total amount of biomass solubilized in the C. thermocellum DSM1313 fermentation platform was 5.8, 10.3, and 13.7% of milled non-pretreated poplar after 24, 48, and 120 h, respectively. These results demonstrate solubilization of 24% cellulose and 17% non-cellulosic sugars after 120 h, consistent with prior reports. The net solubilization of non-cellulosic sugars by C. thermocellum (after correcting for the uninoculated control fermentations) was 13 to 36% of arabinose (Ara), xylose (Xyl), galactose (Gal), mannose (Man), and glucose (Glc); and 15% and 3% of fucose and glucuronic acid, respectively. No rhamnose was solubilized and 71% of the galacturonic acid (GalA) was solubilized. These results indicate that C. thermocellum may be selective for the types and/or rate of solubilization of the non-cellulosic wall polymers. Xyl, Man, and Glc were found to accumulate in the fermentation liquor at levels greater than in uninoculated control fermentations, whereas Ara and Gal did not accumulate, suggesting that C. thermocellum solubilizes both hemicelluloses and pectins but utilizes them differently. After five days of fermentation, the relative amount of Rha in the solid residues increased 21% indicating that the Rha-containing polymer rhamnogalacturonan I (RG-I) was not effectively solubilized by C. thermocellum P0AEM9, a result confirmed by immunoassays. Comparison of the sugars in the liquor versus solid residue showed that C. thermocellum solubilized hemicellulosic xylan and mannan, but did not fully utilize them, solubilized and appeared to utilize pectic homogalacturonan, and did not solubilize RG-I.

1783844	"Dimer Asymmetry and Light Activation Mechanism in Brucella Blue-Light Sensor Histidine Kinase,""The ability to sense and respond to environmental cues is essential for adaptation and survival in living organisms. In bacteria, this process is accomplished by multidomain sensor histidine kinases that undergo autophosphorylation in response to specific stimuli, thereby triggering downstream signaling cascades. However, the molecular mechanism of allosteric activation is not fully understood in these important sensor proteins. Here, we report the full-length crystal structure of a blue light photoreceptor LOV histidine kinase (LOV-P00547) involved in light-dependent virulence modulation in the pathogenic bacterium Brucella abortus. Joint analyses of dark and light structures determined in different signaling states have shown that LOV-P00547 transitions from a symmetric dark structure to a highly asymmetric light state. The initial local and subtle structural signal originated in the chromophore-binding LOV domain alters the dimer asymmetry via a coiled-coil rotary switch and helical bending in the helical spine. These amplified structural changes result in enhanced conformational flexibility and large-scale rearrangements that facilitate the phosphoryl transfer reaction in the P00547 domain."""	mBio (Online)	"('P00547', 'HK')"

For example, linalool synthases are indispensable for the biosynthesis of linalool, an important fragrance used in 60–80% cosmetic and personal care products. However, plant linalool synthases have low activities while expressed in microbes. Aided by bioinformatics analysis, four linalool/nerolidol synthases (LNSs) from various Agaricomycetes were accurately predicted and validated experimentally. Furthermore, we discovered a linalool synthase (Ap.P60716) with exceptionally high levels of selectivity and activity from Agrocybe pediades, ideal for linalool bioproduction. It effectively converted glucose into enantiopure (R)-linalool in Escherichia coli, 44-fold and 287-fold more efficient than its bacterial and plant counterparts, respectively.

1810220	"DNCON2_Inter: predicting interchain contacts for homodimeric and homomultimeric protein complexes using multiple sequence alignments of monomers and deep learning,""Deep learning methods that achieved great success in predicting intrachain residue-residue contacts have been applied to predict interchain contacts between proteins. However, these methods require multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) of a pair of interacting proteins (dimers) as input, which are often difficult to obtain because there are not many known protein complexes available to generate MSAs of sufficient depth for a pair of proteins. In recognizing that multiple sequence alignments of a monomer that forms homomultimers contain the co-evolutionary signals of both intrachain and interchain residue pairs in contact, we applied DNCON2 (a deep learning-based protein intrachain residue-residue contact predictor) to predict both intrachain and interchain contacts for homomultimers using multiple sequence alignment (P08997) and other co-evolutionary features of a single monomer followed by discrimination of interchain and intrachain contacts according to the tertiary structure of the monomer. We name this tool DNCON2_Inter. Allowing true-positive predictions within two residue shifts, the best average precision was obtained for the Top-L/10 predictions of 22.9% for homodimers and 17.0% for higher-order homomultimers. In some instances, especially where interchain contact densities are high, DNCON2_Inter predicted interchain contacts with 100% precision. We also developed Con_Complex, a complex structure reconstruction tool that uses predicted contacts to produce the structure of the complex. Using Con_Complex, we show that the predicted contacts can be used to accurately construct the structure of some complexes. Our experiment demonstrates that monomeric multiple sequence alignments can be used with deep learning to predict interchain contacts of homomeric proteins."""	Scientific Reports	"('P08997', 'MSA')"

1826912	"Metagenomic insights into the taxonomy, function, and dysbiosis of prokaryotic communities in octocorals,""Background. In octocorals (Cnidaria Octocorallia), the functional relationship between host health and its symbiotic consortium has yet to be determined. Here, we employed comparative metagenomics to uncover the distinct functional and phylogenetic features of the microbiomes of healthy Eunicella gazella, Eunicella verrucosa, and Leptogorgia sarmentosa tissues, in contrast with the microbiomes found in seawater and sediments. We further explored how the octocoral microbiome shifts to a pathobiome state in E. gazella. Results. Multivariate analyses based on A8C927 genes, Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins (COGs), Protein families (Pfams), and secondary metabolite-biosynthetic gene clusters annotated from 20 Illumina-sequenced metagenomes each revealed separate clustering of the prokaryotic communities of healthy tissue samples of the three octocoral species from those of necrotic E. gazella tissue and surrounding environments. While the healthy octocoral microbiome was distinguished by so-far uncultivated Endozoicomonadaceae, Oceanospirillales, and Alteromonadales phylotypes in all host species, a pronounced increase of Flavobacteriaceae and Alphaproteobacteria, originating from seawater, was observed in necrotic E. gazella tissue. Increased abundances of eukaryotic-like proteins, exonucleases, restriction endonucleases, CRISPR/Cas proteins, and genes encoding for heat-shock proteins, inorganic ion transport, and iron storage distinguished the prokaryotic communities of healthy octocoral tissue regardless of the host species. An increase of arginase and nitric oxide reductase genes, observed in necrotic E. gazella tissues, suggests the existence of a mechanism for suppression of nitrite oxide production by which octocoral pathogens may overcome the host’s immune system. Conclusions. This is the first study to employ primer-less, shotgun metagenome sequencing to unveil the taxonomic, functional, and secondary metabolism features of prokaryotic communities in octocorals. Our analyses reveal that the octocoral microbiome is distinct from those of the environmental surroundings, is host genus (but not species) specific, and undergoes large, complex structural changes in the transition to the dysbiotic state. Host-symbiont recognition, abiotic-stress response, micronutrient acquisition, and an antiviral defense arsenal comprising multiple restriction endonucleases, CRISPR/Cas systems, and phage lysogenization regulators are signatures of prokaryotic communities in octocorals. We argue that these features collectively contribute to the stabilization of symbiosis in the octocoral holobiont and constitute beneficial traits that can guide future studies on coral reef conservation and microbiome therapy."""

Phosphoketolase (Xpk), commonly found in cyanobacteria, is an enzyme that is linked to all these pathways. However, little is known about its physiological role. Here, we show that most of the cyanobacterial Xpk surveyed are inhibited by P22259, and both copies of Xpk in nitrogen-fixing Cyanothece ATCC51142 are further activated by ADP, suggesting their role in energy regulation. Furthermore, Xpk in Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942 and Cyanothece ATCC51142 show that their expressions are dusk-peaked, suggesting their roles in dark conditions. Finally, we find that Xpk in S. elongatus PCC7942 is responsible for survival using P22259 produced from the glycogen-to-acetate pathway under dark, anaerobic condition. Interestingly, under this condition, xpk deletion causes glucose secretion in response to osmotic shock such as NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, KHCO<sub>3</sub> and NaCl as part of incomplete glycogen degradation.

The sulfenic acid product condenses with the resolving Cys (C172) to form a disulfide which is recycled by thioredoxin or GSH via mixed disulfide intermediates or undergoes hyperoxidation to the sulfinic acid. C172 lies near the C terminus, outside the active site. It is not established whether structural changes in this region, such as mixed disulfide formation, affect H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> reactivity. To investigate, we designed mutants to cause minimal (C172S) or substantial (C172D and C172W) structural disruption. Stopped flow kinetics and mass spectrometry showed that mutation to Ser had minimal effect on rates of oxidation and hyperoxidation, whereas Asp and Trp decreased both by  100-fold. To relate to structural changes, we solved the crystal structures of reduced WT and C172S Prdx2. The WT structure is highly similar to that of the published hyperoxidized form. C172S is closely related but more flexible and as demonstrated by size exclusion chromatography and analytical ultracentrifugation, a weaker decamer. Size exclusion chromatography and analytical ultracentrifugation showed that the C172D and C172W mutants are also weaker decamers than WT, and small-angle X-ray scattering analysis indicated greater flexibility with partially unstructured regions consistent with C-terminal unfolding. We propose that these structural changes around C172 negatively impact the active site geometry to decrease reactivity with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.

Several mutations that affect the proline-tyrosine nuclear localization signal (PY-NLS) of FUS cause severe juvenile ALS. FUS also undergoes liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) to accumulate in stress granules when cells are stressed. In unstressed cells, wild type FUS resides predominantly in the nucleus as it is imported by the importin Karyopherin-β2 (Kapβ2), which binds with high affinity to the C-terminal PY-NLS of FUS. Here, we analyze the interactions between two ALS-related variants FUS(P525L) and FUS(R495X) with importins, especially Kapβ2, since they are still partially localized to the nucleus despite their defective/missing PY-NLSs. The crystal structure of the Kapβ2·FUS(P525L)<sup>PY-NLS</sup> complex shows the mutant peptide making fewer contacts at the mutation site, explaining decreased affinity for Kapβ2. Biochemical analysis revealed that the truncated FUS(R495X) protein, although missing the PY-NLS, can still bind Kapβ2 and suppresses LLPS. FUS(R495X) uses its C-terminal tandem arginine-glycine-glycine regions, RGG2 and RGG3, to bind the PY-NLS binding site of Kapβ2 for nuclear localization in cells when arginine methylation is inhibited.

Chemical shift information derived from relaxation dispersion can be used to generate structural models of weakly populated alternative conformational states. Current methods to obtain such models rely on determining the signs of chemical shift changes between the conformational states, which are difficult to obtain in many situations. Here, we use a “sample and select” method to generate relevant structural models of alternative conformations of the C-terminal-associated region of Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase (P0AFS3), using only unsigned chemical shift changes for backbone amides and carbonyls (<sup>1</sup>H, <sup>15</sup>N, and <sup>13</sup>C').

The results demonstrate that the combination of fragment modeling with sparse chemical shift data can determine the structure of an alternative conformation of P0AFS3 sampled on the μs-ms timescale.

One such mechanism of control has been the use of molybdate (MoO  <sub>4</sub>  <sup>2−</sup>  ), which is thought to be a specific inhibitor of SRM. The way in which molybdate inhibits the growth of SRM has been enigmatic.

The remaining SNP was located in DVU2210, a protein containing two domains: a YcaO-like domain and a tetratricopeptide-repeat domain.

High activities of both pyruvate kinase and PPDK were present, whereas the activities of a malate shunt enzymes were low in T. saccharolyticum.

1737561	"The Specific Carbohydrate Diet and Diet Modification as Induction Therapy for Pediatric Crohn’s Disease: A Randomized Diet Controlled Trial,""Background: Crohn’s disease (P06721) is a chronic inflammatory intestinal disorder associated with intestinal dysbiosis. Diet modulates the intestinal microbiome and therefore has a therapeutic potential. The aim of this study is to determine the potential efficacy of three versions of the specific carbohydrate diet (SCD) in active Crohn’s Disease. Methods: 18 patients with mild/moderate P06721 (PCDAI 15–45) aged 7 to 18 years were enrolled. Patients were randomized to either SCD, modified SCD(MSCD) or whole foods (WF) diet. Patients were evaluated at baseline, 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks. PCDAI, inflammatory labs and multi-omics evaluations were assessed. Results: Mean age was 14.3 ± 2.9 years. At week 12, all participants (n = 10) who completed the study achieved clinical remission. The C-reactive protein decreased from 1.3 ± 0.7 at enrollment to 0.9 ± 0.5 at 12 weeks in the SCD group. In the MSCD group, the P0ACJ8 decreased from 1.6 ± 1.1 at enrollment to 0.7 ± 0.1 at 12 weeks. In the WF group, the P0ACJ8 decreased from 3.9 ± 4.3 at enrollment to 1.6 ± 1.3 at 12 weeks. In addition, the microbiome composition shifted in all patients across the study period. While the nature of the changes was largely patient specific, the predicted metabolic mode of the organisms increasing and decreasing in activity was consistent across patients. Conclusions: This study emphasizes the impact of diet in P06721. Each diet had a positive effect on symptoms and inflammatory burden; the more exclusionary diets were associated with a better resolution of inflammation."""

Unlike the LuxR-type transcriptional regulators of prototype LuxR/LuxI quorum sensing systems, luxR solos do not have a LuxI-type autoinducer synthase gene associated with them. LuxR solos in plant-pathogenic bacteria are important for virulence and in plant endosymbionts contribute to symbiosis. In the present study, we characterized an atypical LuxR solo, PcsR2, in the biological control species Pseudomonas chlororaphis 30–84 that is highly conserved among sequenced P. chlororaphis strains. Unlike most LuxR solos in the plant-associated bacteria characterized to date, pcsR2 is not associated with a proline iminopeptidase gene and the protein has an atypical N-terminal binding domain. We created a pcsR2 deletion mutant and used quantitative P0DV86-PCR to show that the expression of pcsR2 and genes in the operon immediately downstream was upregulated ~10-fold when the wild type strain was grown on wheat roots compared to planktonic culture. PcsR2 was involved in upregulation. Using a GFP transcriptional reporter, we found that expression of pcsR2 responded specifically to root-derived substrates as compared to leaf-derived substrates but not to endogenous AHLs. Compared to the wild type, the mutant was impaired in the ability to utilize root carbon and nitrogen sources in wheat root macerate and to colonize wheat roots. Phenazine production and most biofilm traits previously shown to be correlated with phenazine production also were diminished in the mutant. Gene expression of several of the proteins in the phenazine regulatory network including PhzR, Pip (phenazine inducing protein) and RpeA/RpeB were reduced in the mutant, and overexpression of these genes in trans restored phenazine production in the mutant to wild-type levels, indicating PcsR2 affects the activity of the these regulatory genes upstream of RpeA/RpeB via an undetermined mechanism. Our results indicate PcsR2 upregulates the expression of the adjacent operon in response to unknown wheat root-derived signals and belongs to a novel subfamily of LuxR-type transcriptional regulators found in sequenced P. chlororaphis strains."""

Within the last 2 decades, numerous reports of chromate reductase enzymes have been published. These reports describe catalytic reduction of chromate ions by specific enzymes. These enzymes each have sequence similarity to known redox-active flavoproteins. We investigated the enzyme NfoR from Staphylococcus aureus, which was reported to be upregulated in chromate-rich soils and to have chromate reductase activity (H. Han, Z. Ling, T. Zhou, R. Xu, et al., Sci Rep 7:15481, 2017, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-15588-y). We show that NfoR has structural similarity to known flavin mononucleotide (FMN) reductases and reduces FMN as a substrate. NfoR binds FMN with a dissociation constant of 0.4 μM. The enzyme then binds P80644 with a dissociation constant of 140 μM and reduces the flavin at a rate of 1,350 s<sup>-1</sup>. Turnover of the enzyme is apparently limited by the rate of product release that occurs, with a net rate constant of 0.45 s<sup>-1</sup>. The rate of product release limits the rate of observed chromate reduction, so the net rate of chromate reduction by NfoR is orders of magnitude lower than when this process occurs in solution. We propose that NfoR is an P0AEN1 and that the criterion required to define chromate reduction as enzymatic has not been met. That NfoR expression is increased in the presence of chromate suggests that the survival adaption was to increase the net rate of chromate reduction by facile, adventitious redox processes."""

Our thermostability and X-ray crystallography studies, together with the molecular dynamic simulation studies, demonstrated that m<sup>4</sup>C retains a regular C:G base pairing pattern in RNA duplex and has a relatively small effect on its base pairing stability and specificity. By contrast, the m<sup>4</sup><sub>2</sub>C modification disrupts the C:G pair and significantly decreases the duplex stability through a conformational shift of native Watson-Crick pair to a wobble-like pattern with the formation of two hydrogen bonds. This double-methylated m<sup>4</sup><sub>2</sub>C also results in the loss of base pairing discrimination between C:G and other mismatched pairs like C:A, C:T and C:C. The biochemical investigation of these two modified residues in the reverse transcription model shows that both mono- or di-methylated cytosine bases could specify the C:T pair and induce the G to T mutation using HIV-1 P0DV86. In the presence of other reverse transcriptases with higher fidelity like AMV-P0DV86, the methylation could either retain the normal nucleotide incorporation or completely inhibit the DNA synthesis.

For decades, it has been assumed that the bacterium relies solely on glucose catabolism (via glycolysis) for generation of its P22259. However, the organism’s robust motility, believed to be essential for human tissue invasion and dissemination, would require abundant P22259 likely not provided by the parsimony of glycolysis. As such, additional P22259 generation, either via a chemiosmotic gradient, substrate-level phosphorylation, or both, likely exists in T. pallidum. Along these lines, we have hypothesized that T. pallidum exploits an acetogenic energy conservation pathway that relies on the redox chemistry of flavins. Central to this hypothesis is the apparent existence in T. pallidum of an acetogenic pathway for the conversion of d-lactate to acetate. Herein we have characterized the structural, biophysical, and biochemical properties of the first enzyme (d-lactate dehydrogenase [d-LDH]; TP0037) predicted in this pathway.

Sarecycline is distinguished chemically from other tetracyclines because it has a 7-[[methoxy(methyl)amino]methyl] group attached at the C7 position of ring D. To investigate the functional role of this C7 moiety, we determined the X-ray crystal structure of sarecycline bound to the Thermus thermophilus 70S ribosome. Our 2.8-Å resolution structure revealed that sarecycline binds at the canonical tetracycline binding site located in the decoding center of the small ribosomal subunit. Importantly, unlike other tetracyclines, the unique C7 extension of sarecycline extends into the messenger RNA (mRNA) channel to form a direct interaction with the A-site codon to possibly interfere with mRNA movement through the channel and/or disrupt A-site codon–anticodon interaction. Based on our biochemical studies, sarecycline appears to be a more potent initiation inhibitor compared to other tetracyclines, possibly due to drug interactions with the mRNA, thereby blocking accommodation of the first aminoacyl transfer RNA (P0A873) into the A site.

1756649	"One Electron Multiple Proton Transfer in Model Organic Donor–Acceptor Systems: Implications for High-Frequency EPR,""EPR spectroscopy is an important spectroscopic method for identification and characterization of radical species involved in many biological reactions. The tyrosyl radical is one of the most studied amino acid radical intermediates in biology. Often in conjunction with histidine residues, it is involved in many fundamental biological electron and proton transfer processes, such as in the water oxidation in photosystem II. As biological processes are typically extremely complicated and hard to control, molecular bio-mimetic model complexes are often used to clarify the mechanisms of the biological reactions. In this work, we present theoretical calculations to investigate the sensitivity of magnetic resonance parameters to proton-coupled electron transfer events, as well as conformational substates of the molecular constructs which mimic the tyrosine-histidine (Tyr-His) pairs found in a large variety of proteins. Upon oxidation of the phenol, the Tyr analog, these complexes can perform not only one-electron one-proton transfer (P0A749), but also one-electron two-proton transfers (E2PT). It is shown that in aprotic environment the g<sub>X</sub>-components of the electronicg-tensor are extremely sensitive to the first proton transfer from the phenoxyl oxygen to the imidazole nitrogen (P0A749 product), leading to a significant increase of the g<sub>X</sub>-value of up to 0.003, but are not sensitive to the second proton transfer (E2PT). In the latter case, the change of the g<sub>X</sub>-value is much smaller (ca. 0.0001), which is too small to be distinguished even by high-frequency EPR. The <sup>14</sup>N hyperfine values are also too similar to allow differentiation between the different protonation states in P0A749 and E2PT. The magnetic resonance parameters were also calculated as a function of the rotation angles around single bonds. It was demonstrated that rotation of the phenoxyl group results in large positive changes (> 0.001) in the g<sub>X</sub>-values. Analysis of the data reveals that the main source of these changes is related to the strength of the H-bond between phenoxyl oxygen and the proton(s) on N<sub>1</sub> and N<sub>2</sub> positions of the imidazole."""

1905231	"Bioinformatic and experimental evidence for suicidal and catalytic plant THI4s,""<jats:p>Like fungi and some prokaryotes, plants use a thiazole synthase (THI4) to make the thiazole precursor of thiamin. Fungal THI4s are suicide enzymes that destroy an essential active-site Cys residue to obtain the sulfur atom needed for thiazole formation. In contrast, certain prokaryotic THI4s have no active-site Cys, use sulfide as sulfur donor, and are truly catalytic. The presence of a conserved active-site Cys in plant THI4s and other indirect evidence implies that they are suicidal. To confirm this, we complemented the Arabidopsistz-1 mutant, which lacks THI4 activity, with a His-tagged Arabidopsis THI4 construct. LC–P13009 analysis of tryptic peptides of the THI4 extracted from leaves showed that the active-site Cys was predominantly in desulfurated form, consistent with THI4 having a suicide mechanism in planta. Unexpectedly, transcriptome data mining and deep proteome profiling showed that barley, wheat, and oat have both a widely expressed canonical THI4 with an active-site Cys, and a THI4-like paralog (non-Cys THI4) that has no active-site Cys and is the major type of THI4 in developing grains. Transcriptomic evidence also indicated that barley, wheat, and oat grains synthesize thiamin de novo, implying that their non-Cys THI4s synthesize thiazole. Structure modeling supported this inference, as did demonstration that non-Cys THI4s have significant capacity to complement thiazole auxotrophy in Escherichia coli. There is thus a prima facie case that non-Cys cereal THI4s, like their prokaryotic counterparts, are catalytic thiazole synthases.

Purified recombinant HydAB catalyzed NAD<sup>+</sup> reduction coupled to hydrogen oxidation and produced hydrogen from NADH without the involvement of ferredoxin. Hydrogen partial pressures (2.2 to 40.2 Pa) produced by the purified recombinant HydAB at NADH to NAD<sup>+</sup> ratios of 1 to 5 were similar to the hydrogen partial pressures generated by pure and cocultures of S. aciditrophicus (5.9 to 36.6 Pa). As a result, the hydrogen partial pressures observed in metabolizing cultures and cocultures of S. aciditrophicus can be generated by HydAB if S. aciditrophicus maintains NADH to NAD<sup>+</sup> ratios greater than one. The flavin-containing beta subunits from S. aciditrophicus HydAB and the non-bifurcating NADH-dependent S. wolfei Hyd1ABC share a number of conserved residues with the flavin-containing beta subunits from non-bifurcating NADH-dependent enzymes such as NADH:P0A7E1 oxidoreductases and formate dehydrogenases. A number of differences were observed between sequences of these non-bifurcating NADH-dependent enzymes and [FeFe]-hydrogenases and formate dehydrogenases known to catalyze electron bifurcation including differences in the number of [Fe-S] centers and in conserved residues near predicted cofactor binding sites. These differences can be used to distinguish members of these two groups of enzymes and may be relevant to the differences in ferredoxin-dependence and ability to mediate electron-bifurcation. These findings show that two phylogenetically distinct syntrophic fatty acid-oxidizing bacteria, Syntrophomonas wolfei a member of the phylum Firmicutes, and S. aciditrophicus, a member of the class Deltaproteobacteria, possess functionally similar [FeFe]-hydrogenases that produce hydrogen from NADH during syntrophic fatty acid oxidation without the involvement of reduced ferredoxin.

However, it is a challenge that activity assays of glycosyltransferases are very low throughput and acceptor substrates are generally not available. Results: We optimized and validated microscale thermophoresis (P31142) to achieve high throughput screening for glycosyltransferase substrates. P31142 is a powerful method for the quantitative analysis of protein-ligand interactions with low sample consumption. The technique is based on the motion of molecules along local temperature gradients, measured by fluorescence changes. We expressed glycosyltransferases as YFP-fusion proteins in tobacco and optimized the P31142 method to allow the determination of substrate binding affinity without purification of the target protein from the cell lysate. The application of this P31142 method to the β-1,4-galactosyltransferase AtGALS1 validated the capability to screen both nucleotide-sugar donor substrates and acceptor substrates. We also expanded the application to members of glycosyltransferase family GT61 in sorghum for substrate screening and function prediction. Conclusions: This method is rapid and sensitive to allow determination of both donor and acceptor substrates of glycosyltransferases. P31142 enables high throughput screening of glycosyltransferases for likely substrates, which will narrow down their in vivo function and help to select candidates for further studies.

Here, we determined the links between host genetics, the gut microbiome and memory using the genetically defined Collaborative Cross (CC) mouse cohort, complemented with microbiome and metabolomic analyses in conventional and germ-free (GF) mice. RESULTS:A genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) identified 715 of 76,080 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were significantly associated with short-term memory using the passive avoidance model. The identified SNPs were enriched in genes known to be involved in learning and memory functions. By A8C927 gene sequencing of the gut microbial community in the same CC cohort, we identified specific microorganisms that were significantly correlated with longer latencies in our retention test, including a positive correlation with Lactobacillus. Inoculation of GF mice with individual species of Lactobacillus (L. reuteri F275, L. plantarum BDGP2 or L. brevis BDGP6) resulted in significantly improved memory compared to uninoculated or E. coli DH10B inoculated controls. Untargeted metabolomics analysis revealed significantly higher levels of several metabolites, including lactate, in the stools of Lactobacillus-colonized mice, when compared to GF control mice. Moreover, we demonstrate that dietary lactate treatment alone boosted memory in conventional mice. Mechanistically, we show that both inoculation with Lactobacillus or lactate treatment significantly increased the levels of the neurotransmitter, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), in the hippocampus of the mice.

The limited thermodynamic driving force of glycolysis in C. thermocellum could be attributed in large part to the small free energy of the phosphofructokinase reaction producing fructose bisphosphate.

These observations help explain the comparatively low ethanol titers of C. thermocellum and suggest engineering interventions that can be used to increase its ethanol productivity and glycolytic rate. In addition to thermodynamic analysis, we used our isotope tracer data to reconstruct the T. saccharolyticum central metabolic network, revealing exclusive use of the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) pathway for glycolysis, a bifurcated tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and a sedoheptulose bisphosphate bypass active within the pentose phosphate pathway.

We hypothesized that reproducible, low-complexity communities that represent functional modules could be obtained through targeted enrichments and that, in combination, they would encompass a large extent of the soil microbiome diversity. Enrichments were performed on a starting soil inoculum with defined media based on specific carbon substrates, antibiotics, alternative electron acceptors under anaerobic conditions, or alternative growing conditions reflective of common field stresses. The resultant communities were evaluated through A8C927 amplicon sequencing. Less permissive modules (anaerobic conditions, complex polysaccharides, and certain stresses) resulted in more distinct community profiles with higher richness and more variability between replicates, whereas modules with simple substrates were dominated by fewer species and were more reproducible. Collectively, approximately 27% of unique taxa present in the liquid soil extract control were found across functional modules. Taxa that were underrepresented or undetected in the source soil were also enriched across the modules. Metatranscriptomic analyses were carried out on a subset of the modules to investigate differences in functional gene expression.

With such predictive abilities in hand, researchers would be able to more accurately forecast how organisms will evolve and how proteins with novel functions could be engineered, leading to revolutionary advances in medicine and biotechnology. In this work, we assemble the largest reported set of experimental P62593 β-lactamase folding free energies and use this data in conjunction with previously acquired fitness data and computational free energy predictions to determine how much of the fitness of β-lactamase can be directly predicted by thermodynamic folding and binding free energies. We focus upon β-lactamase because of its long history as a model enzyme and its central role in antibiotic resistance. Based upon a set of 21 β-lactamase single and double mutants expressly designed to influence protein folding, we first demonstrate that modeling software designed to compute folding free energies such as FoldX and PyRosetta can meaningfully, although not perfectly, predict the experimental folding free energies of single mutants. Interestingly, while these techniques also yield sensible double mutant free energies, we show that they do so for the wrong physical reasons. We then go on to assess how well both experimental and computational folding free energies explain single mutant fitness. We find that folding free energies account for, at most, 24% of the variance in β-lactamase fitness values according to linear models and, somewhat surprisingly, complementing folding free energies with computationally-predicted binding free energies of residues near the active site only increases the folding-only figure by a few percent. This strongly suggests that the majority of β-lactamase’s fitness is controlled by factors other than free energies. Overall, our results shed a bright light on to what extent the community is justified in using thermodynamic measures to infer protein fitness as well as how applicable modern computational techniques for predicting free energies will be to the large data sets of multiply-mutated proteins forthcoming."""

1817148	"Heterotrophic Thaumarchaea with Small Genomes Are Widespread in the Dark Ocean,""The Thaumarchaeota is a diverse archaeal phylum comprising numerous lineages that play key roles in global biogeochemical cycling, particularly in the ocean. To date, all genomically characterized marine thaumarchaea are reported to be chemolithoautotrophic ammonia oxidizers. In this study, we report a group of putatively heterotrophic marine thaumarchaea (HMT) with small genome sizes that is globally abundant in the mesopelagic, apparently lacking the ability to oxidize ammonia. We assembled five HMT genomes from metagenomic data and show that they form a deeply branching sister lineage to the ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA). We identify this group in metagenomes from mesopelagic waters in all major ocean basins, with abundances reaching up to 6% of that of AOA. Surprisingly, we predict the HMT have small genomes of ~1 Mbp, and our ancestral state reconstruction indicates this lineage has undergone substantial genome reduction compared to other related archaea. The genomic repertoire of HMT indicates a versatile metabolism for aerobic chemoorganoheterotrophy that includes a divergent form III-a RuBisCO, a 2M respiratory complex I that has been hypothesized to increase energetic efficiency, and a three-subunit heme-copper oxidase complex IV that is absent from AOA. We also identify 21 pyrroloquinoline P0A7E1 (PQQ)-dependent dehydrogenases that are predicted to supply reducing equivalents to the electron transport chain and are among the most highly expressed HMT genes, suggesting these enzymes play an important role in the physiology of this group. Our results suggest that heterotrophic members of the Thaumarchaeota are widespread in the ocean and potentially play key roles in global chemical transformations."""	mSystems	"('P0A7E1', 'quinone')"

To investigate the functional impact of this structural difference, we compared the structure and function of the glucagon receptor (GCGR; family B) with the β<sub>2</sub> adrenergic receptor (β<sub>2</sub>P30870; family A). We determined the structure of the GCGR-G<sub>s</sub> complex by means of cryo–electron microscopy at 3.1-angstrom resolution. This structure shows the distinct break in TM6. Guanosine triphosphate (GTP) turnover, guanosine diphosphate release, GTP binding, and G protein dissociation studies revealed much slower rates for G protein activation by the GCGR compared with the β<sub>2</sub>P30870.

All of these proteins contain the typical heme-binding motif CXXCH and require the Ccm proteins for maturation. Two c-type cytochrome reductases also possess atypical heme-binding sites, the NrfA nitrite reductase (CXXCK) and the SirA sulfte reductase (CX12NKGCH). S. oneidensis MR-1 encodes two cytochrome c synthetases (CcmF and SirE) and two apocytochrome c chaperones (CcmI and SirG). SirE located in the sir gene cluster is required for the maturation of SirA, but not NrfA. Here we show that maturation of SirA requires the combined function of the two apocytochrome c chaperones CcmI and SirG. Loss of either protein resulted in decreased sulfte reductase. Furthermore, SirA was not detected in a mutant that lacked both chaperones, perhaps due to misfolding or instability. These results suggest that CcmI interacts with SirEFG during SirA maturation, and with CcmF during maturation of NrfA. Additionally, we show that P0ACJ8 regulates expression of sirA via the newly identifed transcriptional regulatory protein, SirR."""	Scientific Reports	"('P0ACJ8', 'CRP')"

Targeted bacterial P05804 inhibitors have been shown to partially alleviate irinotecan-induced GI tract damage and resultant diarrhea in mice. Here, we unravel the mechanistic basis for GI protection by gut microbial P05804 inhibitors using in vivo models. We use in vitro, in fimo, and in vivo models to determine whether P05804 inhibition alters the anticancer efficacy of irinotecan. We demonstrate that a single dose of irinotecan increases GI bacterial P05804 activity in 1 d and reduces intestinal epithelial cell proliferation in 5 d, both blocked by a single dose of a P05804 inhibitor. In a tumor xenograft model, P05804 inhibition prevents intestinal toxicity and maintains the antitumor efficacy of irinotecan. Remarkably, P05804 inhibitor also effectively blocks the striking irinotecan-induced bloom of Enterobacteriaceae in immune-deficient mice. In a genetically engineered mouse model of cancer, P05804 inhibition alleviates gut damage, improves survival, and does not alter gut microbial composition; however, by allowing dose intensification, it dramatically improves irinotecan’s effectiveness, reducing tumors to a fraction of that achieved by irinotecan alone, while simultaneously promoting epithelial regeneration. These results indicate that targeted gut microbial enzyme inhibitors can improve cancer chemotherapeutic outcomes by protecting the gut epithelium from microbial dysbiosis and proliferative crypt damage."""

1647382	"Structure and function of a flavin-dependent S-monooxygenase from garlic (<em>Allium sativum</em>),""Allicin is a component of the characteristic smell and flavor of garlic (<em>Allium sativum</em>). A flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO) produced by <em>A. sativum</em> (AsFMO) was previously proposed to oxidize S-allyl-<small>L</small>-cysteine (SAC) to alliin, an allicin precursor. In this paper, we present a kinetic and structural characterization of AsFMO that suggests a possible contradiction to this proposal. Results of steady-state kinetic analyses revealed that AsFMO exhibited negligible activity with SAC; however, the enzyme was highly active with <small>L</small>-cysteine, N-acetyl-<small>L</small>-cysteine, and allyl mercaptan. We found that allyl mercaptan with P80644 was the preferred substrate-cofactor combination. Rapid-reaction kinetic analyses showed that P80644 binds tightly ($K_D$ of ~2 μM) to AsFMO and that the hydride transfer occurs with pro-R stereospecificity. We detected the formation of a long-wavelength band when AsFMO was reduced by P80644, probably representing the formation of a charge-transfer complex. In the absence of substrate, the reduced enzyme, in complex with NADP<sup>+</sup>, reacted with oxygen and formed an intermediate with a spectrum characteristic of C4a-hydroperoxyflavin, which decays several orders of magnitude more slowly than the $k$<sub>cat</sub>. The presence of substrate enhanced C4a-hydroperoxyflavin formation and, upon hydroxylation, oxidation occurred with a rate constant similar to the $k$<sub>cat</sub>. The structure of AsFMO complexed with FAD at 2.08-Å resolution features two domains for binding of FAD and P80644, representative of class B flavin monooxygenases. These biochemical and structural results are consistent with AsFMO being an S-monooxygenase involved in allicin biosynthesis through direct formation of sulfenic acid and not SAC oxidation."""

The emphasis is on the reliable and sustained generation of ozone gas concentrations of sufficient concentration and duration to create an effective virucidal environment to achieve more than 95% to 99% viral inactivation, based upon the data already published in the peer-review literature on this topic. The suggestion that ozone be used to inactivate virus is certainly not a new idea. Our objective in this report is to make clear that the necessary levels of ozone can be improvised using simple, easy-to-use, inexpensive, and widely available supplies, and that there is every theoretical and experimental reason to believe that this approach is as highly effective in viral inactivation by ozone as are the far more expensive, complex, cumbersome, and less available equivalent ozone (and other) disinfectant systems that have themselves become unavailable during times of pandemic crisis. Using multiple types of readily available commercial ozone generators, concentration in the tested improvised enclosure is tracked over time to assess ozone charging and decay rates, and the ozone quenching effects of items placed in the box. Generator performance is compared against published ozone dosage values for virucidal and antimicrobial activity. Bubbler and box-fan-type ozone generators were found to be effective at achieving and maintaining target concentrations of 10ppm ozone or higher, whereas automotive cigarette lighter and universal serial bus type plug in “air freshener” ozone generators could not achieve the target concentrations in these experiments.

This study was motivated by our interest in better understanding the microbiome structure and composition of the ascidian, Synoicum adareanum, in which palmerolide A (PalA), a bioactive macrolide with specificity against melanoma, was isolated. PalA bears structural resemblance to a hybrid nonribosomal peptide-polyketide that has similarities to microbially-produced macrolides. We conducted a spatial survey to assess both PalA levels and microbiome composition in S. adareanum in a region of the Antarctic Peninsula near Anvers Island (64°46' S, 64°03' W).

Light is absorbed by photosynthetic pigments and transferred to photochemical reaction centers to initiate electron and proton transfer reactions to store energy in a redox gradient and an electrochemical proton gradient (proton motive force, pmf), composed of a concentration gradient (DpH) and an electric field (Dy), which drives the synthesis of P22259 through the thylakoid F<sub>o</sub>F<sub>1</sub>- P22259 synthase. Although P22259 synthase structure and function are conserved across biological kingdoms, the number of membrane–embedded ion–binding c subunits varies between organisms, ranging from 8 to 17, theoretically altering the H<sup>+</sup>/P22259 ratio for different P22259 synthase complexes, with profound implications for the bioenergetic processes of cellular metabolism. Of the known c–ring stoichiometries, photosynthetic c–rings are among the largest identified stoichiometries, and it has been proposed that decreasing the c-stoichiometry could increase the energy conversion efficiency of photosynthesis. Indeed, there is strong evidence that the high H<sup>+</sup>/P22259 of the chloroplast P22259 synthase results in a low P22259/nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (P80644) ratio produced by photosynthetic linear electron flow, requiring secondary processes such as cyclic electron flow to support downstream metabolism. We hypothesize that the larger c subunit stoichiometry observed in photosynthetic P22259 synthases was selected for because it allows the thylakoid to maintain pmf in a range where P22259 synthesis is supported, but avoids excess Dy and DpH, both of which can lead to production of reactive oxygen species and subsequent photodamage. Numerical kinetic simulations of the energetics of chloroplast photosynthetic reactions with altered c– ring size predicts the energy storage of pmf and its effects on the photochemical reaction centers strongly support this hypothesis, suggesting that, despite the low efficiency and suboptimal P22259/P80644 ratio, a high H<sup>+</sup>/P22259 is favored to avoid photodamage.

To address this question, we used a rich genomic data set of 327 species that covers nearly one third of the known biodiversity of the budding yeast subphylum Saccharomycotina. We found that, while genome-wide relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) for all codons was highly correlated with the GC content of the third codon position (GC3), the usage of codons for the amino acids proline, arginine, and glycine was inconsistent with the neutral expectation where mutational bias coupled with genetic drift drive codon usage. Examination between genes’ effective numbers of codons and their GC3 contents in individual genomes revealed that nearly a quarter of genes (381,174/1,683,203; 23%), as well as most genomes (308/327; 94%), significantly deviate from the neutral expectation. Finally, by evaluating the imprint of translational selection on codon usage, measured as the degree to which genes’ adaptiveness to the P0A873 pool were correlated with selective pressure, we show that translational selection is widespread in budding yeast genomes (264/327; 81%). These results suggest that the contribution of translational selection and drift to patterns of synonymous codon usage across budding yeasts varies across codons, genes, and genomes; whereas drift is the primary driver of global codon usage across the subphylum, the codon bias of large numbers of genes in the majority of genomes is influenced by translational selection."""

1578228	"Molecular basis for the interaction between human choline kinase alpha and the SH3 domain of the c-Src tyrosine kinase,""Choline kinase alpha is a 457-residue protein that catalyzes the reaction between P22259 and choline to yield ADP and phosphocholine. This metabolic action has been well studied because of choline kinase’s link to cancer malignancy and poor patient prognosis. As the myriad of x-ray crystal structures available for this enzyme show, chemotherapeutic drug design has centered on stopping the catalytic activity of choline kinase and reducing the downstream metabolites it produces. Furthermore, these crystal structures only reveal the catalytic domain of the protein, residues 80–457. However, recent studies provide evidence for a non-catalytic protein-binding role for choline kinase alpha. Here, we show that choline kinase alpha interacts with the SH3 domain of c-Src. Co-precipitation assays, surface plasmon resonance, and crystallographic analysis of a 1.5 Å structure demonstrate that this interaction is specific and is mediated by the poly-proline region found N-terminal to the catalytic domain of choline kinase. Taken together, these data offer strong evidence that choline kinase alpha has a heretofore underappreciated role in protein-protein interactions, which offers an exciting new way to approach drug development against this cancer-enhancing protein."""

NO and the sGC-specific stimulator YC-1 induce a 71° rotation of the heme-binding β H-NOX and PAS domains. Repositioning of the β H-NOX domain leads to a straightening of the coiled-coil domains, which, in turn, use the motion to move the catalytic domains into an active conformation. YC-1 binds directly between the β H-NOX domain and the two CC domains.

To determine how these functions may be related, we investigated the kinetic properties of Flv1 and Flv3 from <em>Synechocystis</em> sp. PCC 6803. Under an oxygen atmosphere, Flv1 and Flv3 were found to catalyze ORR with either NADH or P80644 as the electron donor. Reaction velocity curves were sigmoidal and Flv binding of NAD(P)H was cooperative. Based on mass spectrometry generated structural models, each Flv assembles as a homodimer with two oxidoreductase domains capable of binding two molecules of NAD(P)H per subunit, and the flavins are arranged to support electron transfer to the diiron sites for oxygen reduction. Titrations with NAD(P)H resulted in reduction of the diiron site without the accumulation of stable, reduced flavin intermediates.

Although lysine residue at 72 (K72) of Cyt c plays an important role in the Cyt c-Apaf-1 interaction, the underlying mechanism of interaction between Cyt c and Apaf-1 is still not clearly defined. Here we identified multiple lysine residues including K72, which are also known to interact with P22259, to play a key role in Cyt c-Apaf-1 interaction. Mutation of these lysine residues abrogates the apoptosome formation causing inhibition of caspase activation. Using in-silico molecular docking, we have identified Cyt c-binding interface on Apaf-1. Although mutant Cyt c shows higher affinity for Apaf-1, the presence of Cyt c-WT restores the apoptosome activity. P22259 addition modulates only mutant Cyt c binding to Apaf-1 but not WT Cyt c binding to Apaf-1.

Although a variety of metabolisms exist within this group, the reduction of growth substrates to methane using electrons from molecular hydrogen is, in a phylogenetic sense, the most widespread methanogenic pathway. Methanogens without cytochromes typically generate methane by the reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> with electrons derived from H<sub>2</sub>, formate, or secondary alcohols, generating a transmembrane ion gradient for P22259 production via an Na<sup>+-</sup>translocating methyltransferase (Mtr).

1604729	"Interconnection of the Antenna Pigment 8-HDF and Flavin Facilitates Red-Light Reception in a P0AG24 Animal-like Cryptochrome,""Cryptochromes are ubiquitous flavin-binding light sensors closely related to DNA-repairing photolyases. The animal-like cryptochrome CraCRY from the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii challenges the paradigm of cryptochromes as pure blue-light receptors by acting as a (6-4) photolyase, using 8-hydroxy-5-deazaflavin (8-HDF) as a light-harvesting antenna with a 17.4 Å distance to flavin and showing spectral sensitivity up to 680 nm. The expanded action spectrum is attributed to the presence of the flavin neutral radical (FADH•) in the dark, despite a rapid FADH• decay observed in vitro in samples exclusively carrying flavin. Herein, the red-light response of CraCRY carrying flavin and 8-HDF was studied, revealing a 3-fold prolongation of the FADH• lifetime in the presence of 8-HDF. Millisecond time-resolved ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy showed the red-light-induced formation and decay of an absorbance band at 458 nm concomitant with flavin reduction. Time-resolved Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and density functional theory attributed these changes to the deprotonation of 8-HDF, challenging the paradigm of 8-HDF being permanently deprotonated in photolyases. FTIR spectra showed changes in the hydrogen bonding network of asparagine 395, a residue suggested to indirectly control flavin protonation, indicating the involvement of N395 in the stabilization of FADH•. Fluorescence spectroscopy revealed a decrease in the energy transfer efficiency of 8-HDF upon flavin reduction, possibly linked to 8-HDF deprotonation. Finally, the discovery of the interdependence of flavin and 8-HDF beyond energy transfer processes highlights the essential role of the antenna, introducing a new concept enabling CraCRY and possibly other bifunctional cryptochromes to fulfill their dual function."""

1524610	"Engineering Clostridia for <em>n</em>-Butanol Production from Lignocellulosic Biomass and CO<sub>2</sub> (Final Report),""The objective of this project was to engineer novel Clostridium strains to produce n-butanol from low-cost lignocellulosic biomass and gases (CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>). Butanol is an important industrial solvent and potentially a superior fuel that can fit the existing fuel infrastructure and replace gasoline in auto engines without modification. This project focused on metabolic engineering of cellulolytic Clostridium cellulovorans for directly converting cellulose to n-butanol and carboxydotrophic Clostridium carboxidivorans to convert CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub> to butanol and ethanol. These clostridial strains were engineered using synthetic biology, gene overexpression and gene knockout strategies to produce n-butanol as the main product from lignocellulose and gaseous substrates. With these metabolically engineered strains, high-titer and high-yield n-butanol production from lignocellulosic biomass were achieved with minimal CO<sub>2</sub> released to the environment in a sustainable and co-cultured consolidated bioprocess (P0AEM9) integrated with in situ butanol separation by gas stripping. A well-to-pump life cycle analysis showed that the integrated biobutanol production process could reduce CO<sub>2</sub> and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by ~75% compared to traditional chemical process. Moreover, the production of cellulosic butanol from P0AEM9 would not require enzymatic hydrolysis, an expensive step in current biorefinery using lignocellulosic biomass. The successful development of P0AEM9 using engineered clostridia for n-butanol production from lignocellulosic biomass and CO<sub>2</sub> can meet the BETO 2022 cost target of $\$ $3/gallon gasoline equivalent (gge) for advanced biofuels. With the higher energy content, butanol will be cheaper than ethanol and similar to gasoline at $\$ $2.50/gal in terms of energy cost ($\$ $ per MJ). With the reduced production cost and product value, biobutanol from lignocellulose and CO<sub>2</sub> can one day become a major liquid transportation biofuel, replacing bioethanol and gasoline. Strain development via metabolic engineering and fermentation process optimization, assisted by omic analysis of the mutation and process effects, helped us to achieve our goal of producing n-butanol and ethanol (biofuel) from lignocellulosic biomass at a cost of $3/gge (gallon gasoline equivalent) or less. The co-fermentation technology using both cellulose and CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>2</sub> for biofuel production can greatly increase product yield from the biomass feedstock while also reduce GHG emissions, and is novel and advantageous compared to existing ethanol and acetone-butanol-ethanol fermentation technologies. The same metabolic engineering and process approaches can also be applied to other microorganisms to produce bio-based chemicals from renewable resources. Overall, the P0AEM9 technology using the novel engineered clostridia is unique and innovative, and complements well with the Biochemical Conversion technologies in the BETO Multi-Year Program Plan (MYPP), which largely focuses on the hydrolysis of cellulosic biomass and utilization of the hydrolysates for ethanol production."""

1902572	"The molecular basis of allostery in a facilitated dissociation process,""Facilitated dissociation provides a mechanism by which high-affinity complexes can be rapidly disassembled. The negative feedback regulator CITED2 efficiently downregulates the hypoxic response by displacing the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor HIF-1α from the TAZ1 domain of the transcriptional coactivators CREB-binding protein (P0AEM9) and p300. Displacement occurs by a facilitated dissociation mechanism involving a transient ternary intermediate formed by binding of the intrinsically disordered CITED2 activation domain to the TAZ1:HIF-1α complex. The short lifetime of the intermediate precludes straightforward structural investigations. To obtain insights into the molecular determinants of facilitated dissociation, we model the ternary intermediate by generating a fusion peptide composed of the primary CITED2 and HIF-1α binding motifs. X-ray crystallographic and NMR studies of the fusion peptide complex reveal TAZ1-mediated negative cooperativity that results in nearly mutually exclusive binding of specific CITED2 and HIF-1α interaction motifs, providing molecular-level insights into the allosteric switch that terminates the hypoxic response."""

Our structure of a<italic>Rubrobacter radiotolerans</italic>(RsiG)<sub>2</sub>–(c-di-P24174)<sub>2</sub>–WhiG complex revealed that these single-motif RsiGs are able to form an antiparallel coiled-coil through homodimerization, thereby allowing them to bind c-di-P24174 similar to the monomeric twin-motif RsiGs. Further data show that in the unicellular actinobacterium <em>R. radiotolerans</em>, the (RsiG)<sub>2</sub>–(c-di-P24174)<sub>2</sub>–WhiG regulatory switch controls type IV pilus expression. Phylogenetic analysis indicates the single-motif RsiGs likely represent the ancestral state and an internal gene-duplication event gave rise to the twin-motif RsiGs inherited elsewhere in the Actinobacteria. Thus, these studies show how the anti-σ RsiG has evolved through an intragenic duplication event from a small protein carrying a single c-di-P24174 binding motif, which functions as a homodimer, to a larger protein carrying two c-di-P24174 binding motifs, which functions as a monomer.

ATR is also a chaperone that escorts AdoCbl, transferring it to methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, which is important in propionate metabolism. Mutations in ATR lead to methylmalonic aciduria type B, an inborn error of B12 metabolism. Our previous studies have furnished insights into how ATR protein dynamics influence redox-linked cobalt coordination chemistry, controlling its catalytic versus chaperone functions. In this study, we have characterized three patient mutations at two conserved active site residues in human ATR, R190C/H, and E193K and obtained crystal structures of R190C and E193K variants, which display only subtle structural changes. All three mutations were found to weaken affinities for the cob(II)alamin substrate and the AdoCbl product and increase K<sub>M(P22259)</sub>. <sup>31</sup>P NMR studies show that binding of the triphosphate product, formed during the adenosylation reaction, is also weakened. However, although the k<sub>cat</sub> of this reaction is significantly diminished for the R190C/H mutants, it is comparable with the WT enzyme for the E193K variant, revealing the catalytic importance of Arg-190. Furthermore, although the E193K mutation selectively impairs the chaperone function by promoting product release into solution, its catalytic function might be unaffected at physiological P22259 concentrations. In contrast, the R190C/H mutations affect both the catalytic and chaperoning activities of ATR.

Normal mammalian cells are not dependent on P76503, while tumor cells, fungi, and parasites rely on acetate as a precursor for acetyl CoA. Consequently, P76503 have emerged as a potential drug target. As part of a program to develop antifungal P38135 inhibitors, we characterized fungal P76503 from five diverse human fungal pathogens using biochemical and structural studies. P76503 catalyze a two-step reaction involving adenylation of acetate followed by thioesterification with CoA. Our structural studies captured each step of these two half-reactions including the acetyl-adenylate intermediate of the first half-reaction in both the adenylation conformation and the thioesterification conformation and thus provide a detailed picture of the reaction mechanism. We also used a systematic series of increasingly larger alkyl adenosine esters as chemical probes to characterize the structural basis of the exquisite P38135 specificity for acetate over larger carboxylic acid substrates. Consistent with previous biochemical and genetic data for other enzymes, structures of fungal P76503 with these probes bound show that a key tryptophan residue limits the size of the alkyl binding site and forces larger alkyl chains to adopt high energy conformers, disfavoring their efficient binding. Together, our analysis provides highly detailed structural models for both the reaction mechanism and substrate specificity that should be useful in designing selective inhibitors of eukaryotic P76503 as potential anticancer, antifungal, and antiparasitic drugs."""

1782010	"Engineering a Highly Efficient Carboligase for Synthetic One-Carbon Metabolism,""One of the biggest challenges to realize a circular carbon economy is the synthesis of complex carbon compounds from one-carbon (C1) building blocks. Since the natural solution space of C1-C1 condensations is limited to highly complex enzymes, the development of more simple and robust biocatalysts may facilitate the engineering of C1 assimilation routes. Thiamine diphosphatedependent enzymes harbor great potential for this task, due to their ability to create C-C bonds. Here, we employed structure-guided iterative saturation mutagenesis to convert oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase (OXC) from Methylobacterium extorquens into a glycolyl-CoA synthase (P0A6W9) that allows for the direct condensation of the two C1 units formyl-CoA and formaldehyde. A quadruple variant MeOXC4 showed a 100 000-fold switch between OXC and P0A6W9 activities, a 200-fold increase in the P0A6W9 activity compared to the wild type, and formaldehyde affinity that is comparable to natural formaldehyde-converting enzymes. Notably, MeOCX4 outcompetes all other natural and engineered enzymes for C1-C1 condensations by more than 40-fold in catalytic efficiency and is highly soluble in Escherichia coli. In addition to the increased P0A6W9 activity, MeOXC4 showed up to 300-fold higher activity than the wild type toward a broad range of carbonyl acceptor substrates. Finally, when applied in vivo, MeOXC4 enables the production of glycolate from formaldehyde, overcoming the current bottleneck of C1- C1 condensation in whole-cell bioconversions and paving the way toward synthetic C1 assimilation routes in vivo."""

1788019	"A method for achieving complete microbial genomes and improving bins from metagenomics data,""Metagenomics facilitates the study of the genetic information from uncultured microbes and complex microbial communities. Assembling complete genomes from metagenomics data is difficult because most samples have high organismal complexity and strain diversity. Some studies have attempted to extract complete bacterial, archaeal, and viral genomes and often focus on species with circular genomes so they can help confirm completeness with circularity. However, less than 100 circularized bacterial and archaeal genomes have been assembled and published from metagenomics data despite the thousands of datasets that are available. Circularized genomes are important for (1) building a reference collection as scaffolds for future assemblies, (2) providing complete gene content of a genome, (3) confirming little or no contamination of a genome, (4) studying the genomic context and synteny of genes, and (5) linking protein coding genes to ribosomal RNA genes to aid metabolic inference in A8C927 gene sequencing studies. We developed a semi-automated method called Jorg to help circularize small bacterial, archaeal, and viral genomes using iterative assembly, binning, and read mapping. In addition, this method exposes potential misassemblies from k-mer based assemblies. We chose species of the Candidate Phyla Radiation (CPR) to focus our initial efforts because they have small genomes and are only known to have one ribosomal RNA operon. In addition to 34 circular CPR genomes, we present one circular Margulisbacteria genome, one circular Chloroflexi genome, and two circular megaphage genomes from 19 public and published datasets. We demonstrate findings that would likely be difficult without circularizing genomes, including that ribosomal genes are likely not operonic in the majority of CPR, and that some CPR harbor diverged forms of RNase P RNA.

For the foodborne pathogen norovirus, multiple aptamers exist but have not been thoroughly characterized. Consequently, there is little research on aptamer-mediated assay development. This study characterized seven previously described norovirus aptamers for target affinity, structure, and potential use in extraction and detection assays. Norovirus-aptamer affinities were determined by filter retention assays using norovirus genotype (G) I.1, GI.7, GII.3, GII.4 New Orleans and GII.4 Sydney virus-like particles. Of the seven aptamers characterized, equilibrium dissociation constants for GI.7, GII.3, GII.4 New Orleans and GII.4 Sydney ranged from 71 ± 38 to 1777 ± 1021 nM. Four aptamers exhibited affinity to norovirus GII.4 strains; three aptamers additionally exhibited affinity toward GII.3 and GI.7. Aptamer affinity towards GI.1 was not observed. Aptamer structure analysis by circular dichroism (P06721) spectroscopy showed that six aptamers exhibit B-DNA structure, and one aptamer displays parallel/antiparallel G-quadruplex hybrid structure. P06721 studies also showed that biotinylated aptamer structures were unchanged from non-biotinylated aptamers.

A leading vaccine candidate is the surface P08957, a major virulence determinant and protective Ag. An obstacle to the development of P08957–based vaccines is the >200 different M types defined by the N-terminal sequences that contain protective epitopes. Despite sequence variability, M proteins share coiled-coil structural motifs that bind host proteins required for virulence. In this study, we exploit this potential Achilles heel of conserved structure to predict cross-reactive M peptides that could serve as broadly protective vaccine Ags. Combining sequences with structural predictions, six heterologous M peptides in a sequence-related cluster were predicted to elicit cross-reactive Abs with the remaining five nonvaccine M types in the cluster. The six-valent vaccine elicited Abs in rabbits that reacted with all 11 M peptides in the cluster and functional opsonic Abs against vaccine and nonvaccine M types in the cluster. We next immunized mice with four sequence-unrelated M peptides predicted to contain different coiled-coil propensities and tested the antisera for cross-reactivity against 41 heterologous M peptides. Based on these results, we developed an improved algorithm to select cross-reactive peptide pairs using additional parameters of coiled-coil length and propensity. The revised algorithm accurately predicted cross-reactive Ab binding, improving the Matthews correlation coefficient from 0.42 to 0.74. These results form the basis for selecting the minimum number of N-terminal M peptides to include in potentially broadly efficacious multivalent vaccines that could impact the overall global burden of group A streptococcal diseases."""

Secondary metabolism, such as terpene biosynthesis, has evolved with low carbon flux due to inherent pathway constraints. Thraustochytrids are a group of heterotrophic marine unicellular protists and can accumulate terpenoids under the high-salt conditions in their natural environment. However, the mechanism behind terpene accumulation is not well understood. Here, we show that terpene biosynthesis in Thraustochytrium sp.

Thermodynamic analysis reveals metabolite limitation in the nondecarboxylative Claisen condensation of acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) to the acetoacetyl-CoA step, catalyzed by the acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase (P65643). Through a sodium-elicited mechanism, higher respiration leads to increased P22259 investment into the mevalonate pathway, providing a strong thermodynamic driving force for enhanced terpene biosynthesis. Proteomic and metabolomic analyses further show that the increased P22259 demands are fulfilled by shifting energy generation from carbohydrate to lipid oxidation.

We utilize 2-stage dynamic metabolic control to compare two approaches to optimize xylitol biosynthesis, a stoichiometric approach, wherein competitive fluxes are decreased, and a regulatory approach wherein the levels of key regulatory metabolites are reduced. The stoichiometric and regulatory approaches lead to a 20-fold and 90-fold improvement in xylitol production, respectively.

MP were encapsulated in BμEs through preparation of Winsor‐III systems at optimal salinity, with the anionic surfactants AOT and SDS providing the driving force for extraction. Dissolution of ASYN in BμEs greatly increased the former's α‐helicity, similar to ASYN's behavior in the presence of biomembranes, while BμE‐ and vesicle‐encapsulated BR possessed similar secondary structure. Small‐angle neutron scattering (SANS) results clearly demonstrated the direct interaction of MP with the surfactants, resulting in a decrease of surface area per volume for surfactant monolayers due to decreased surfactant efficiency. The SANS signal for ASYN was isolated through the use of neutron contrast matching for the surfactants through partial deuteration of water and oil, one of the first reports of contrast matching for BμEs in the literature. The SANS results of the contrast‐matched sample reflected similar aggregation for ASYN in BμEs as was reported previously for vesicles and SDS solution. This study demonstrates the potential use of BμEs as MP host systems for conducting biochemical reactions such as the conversion of sunlight into adenosine triphosphate by BR and studying the fundamental behavior of MP, such as the role of ASYN dysfunction in Parkinson's disease, as well as for isolation and purification of MP via Winsor‐III‐based extraction.</p>"""	Journal of Surfactants and Detergents	"('P0A6I0', 'CK')"
1808525	"Inactivation of Human Coronavirus by FATHHOME’s Dry Sanitizer Device: Rapid and Eco-Friendly Ozone-Based Disinfection of SARS-CoV-2,""The pandemic of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 was reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. Pertaining to its high transmissibility and wide host adaptability, this unique human coronavirus spread across the planet inflicting 115 million people and causing 2.5 million deaths (as of March 3rd, 2021). Limited or negligible pre-existing immunity to multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants has resulted in severe morbidity and mortality worldwide, as well as a record-breaking surge in the use of medical-surgical supplies and personal protective equipment. In response to the global need for effective sterilization techniques, this study evaluated the virucidal efficacy of FATHHOME’s self-contained, ozone-based dry-sanitizing device, by dose and time response assessment. We tested inactivation of human coronavirus, HCoV-OC43, a close genetic model of SARS-CoV-2, on porous (N95 filtering facepiece respirator/FFR) and nonporous (glass) surfaces. We started our assays with 20 ppm-10 min ozone exposure, and effectively reduced 99.8% and 99.9% of virus from glass and N95 FFR surfaces, respectively. Importantly, the virus was completely inactivated, below the detection limit (over 6-log10 reduction) with 25 ppm-15 min ozone exposure on both tested surfaces. As expected, a higher ozone exposure (50 ppm-10 min) resulted in faster inactivation of HCoV-OC43 with 100% inactivation from both the surfaces, with no residual ozone present after completion of the 5-min post exposure recapture cycle and no measurable increase in ambient ozone levels. These results confirmed that FATHHOME’s device is suitable for rapid decontamination of SARS-CoV-2- from worn items, frequently touched items, and P0AG07 including N95 FFRs, face shields, and other personal items.

1716726	"Trehalose Degradation by <em>Cellvibrio japonicus</em> Exhibits No Functional Redundancy and Is Solely Dependent on the P13482 Enzyme,""The α-diglucoside trehalose has historically been known as a component of the bacterial stress response, though it more recently has been studied for its relevance in human gut health and biotechnology development. The utilization of trehalose as a nutrient source by bacteria relies on carbohydrate-active enzymes, specifically those of the glycoside hydrolase family 37 (GH37), to degrade the disaccharide into substituent glucose moieties for entry into metabolism. Environmental bacteria using oligosaccharides for nutrients often possess multiple carbohydrate-active enzymes predicted to have the same biochemical activity and therefore are thought to be functionally redundant. In this study, we characterized trehalose degradation by the biotechnologically important saprophytic bacterium Cellvibrio japonicus This bacterium possesses two predicted α-α-trehalase genes, tre37A and tre37B, and our investigation using mutational analysis found that only the former is essential for trehalose utilization by C. japonicus Heterologous expression experiments found that only the expression of the C. japonicus tre37A gene in an Escherichia coli treA mutant strain allowed for full utilization of trehalose. Biochemical characterization of C. japonicus GH37 activity determined that the tre37A gene product is solely responsible for cleaving trehalose and is an acidic α-α-trehalase. Bioinformatic and mutational analyses indicate that P13482 directly cleaves trehalose to glucose in the periplasm, as C. japonicus does not possess a phosphotransferase system. This study facilitates the development of a comprehensive metabolic model for α-linked disaccharides in C. japonicus and more broadly expands our understanding of the strategies that saprophytic bacteria employ to capture diverse carbohydrates from the environment. The metabolism of trehalose is becoming increasingly important due to the inclusion of this α-diglucoside in a number of foods and its prevalence in the environment. Bacteria able to utilize trehalose in the human gut possess a competitive advantage, as do saprophytic microbes in terrestrial environments. While the biochemical mechanism of trehalose degradation is well understood, what is less clear is how bacteria acquire this metabolite from the environment. The significance of this report is that by using the model saprophyte Cellvibrio japonicus, we were able to functionally characterize the two predicted trehalase enzymes that the bacterium possesses and determined that the two enzymes are not equivalent and are not functionally redundant. Here, the results and approaches used to understand the complex physiology of α-diglucoside metabolism from this study can be applied broadly to other polysaccharide-degrading bacteria."""

1756136	"Predicting drug-metagenome interactions: Variation in the microbial β-glucuronidase level in the human gut metagenomes,""<p>Characterizing the gut microbiota in terms of their capacity to interfere with drug metabolism is necessary to achieve drug efficacy and safety. Although examples of drug-microbiome interactions are well-documented, little has been reported about a computational pipeline for systematically identifying and characterizing bacterial enzymes that process particular classes of drugs. The goal of our study is to develop a computational approach that compiles drugs whose metabolism may be influenced by a particular class of microbial enzymes and that quantifies the variability in the collective level of those enzymes among individuals. The present paper describes this approach, with microbial β-glucuronidases as an example, which break down drug-glucuronide conjugates and reactivate the drugs or their metabolites. We identified 100 medications that may be metabolized by β-glucuronidases from the gut microbiome. These medications included morphine, estrogen, ibuprofen, midazolam, and their structural analogues. The analysis of metagenomic data available through the Sequence Read Archive (P68191) showed that the level of β-glucuronidase in the gut metagenomes was higher in males than in females, which provides a potential explanation for the sex-based differences in efficacy and toxicity for several drugs, reported in previous studies. Our analysis also showed that infant gut metagenomes at birth and 12 months of age have higher levels of β-glucuronidase than the metagenomes of their mothers and the implication of this observed variability was discussed in the context of breastfeeding as well as infant hyperbilirubinemia. Overall, despite important limitations discussed in this paper, our analysis provided useful insights on the role of the human gut metagenome in the variability in drug response among individuals. Importantly, this approach exploits drug and metagenome data available in public databases as well as open-source cheminformatics and bioinformatics tools to predict drug-metagenome interactions.</p>"""	PLoS ONE	"('P68191', 'SRA')"

The AAA<sup>+</sup> ATPase TRIP13 remodels Shieldin to regulate DNA repair pathway choice. Here we report crystal structures of human SHLD3–REV7 binary and fused SHLD2–SHLD3–REV7 ternary complexes, revealing that assembly of Shieldin requires fused SHLD2–SHLD3 induced conformational heterodimerization of open (O-REV7) and closed (C-REV7) forms of REV7. We also report the cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of the ATPγS-bound fused SHLD2–SHLD3–REV7–TRIP13 complexes, uncovering the principles underlying the TRIP13-mediated disassembly mechanism of the Shieldin complex. We demonstrate that the N terminus of REV7 inserts into the central channel of TRIP13, setting the stage for pulling the unfolded N-terminal peptide of C-REV7 through the central TRIP13 hexameric channel. The primary interface involves contacts between the safety-belt segment of C-REV7 and a conserved and negatively charged loop of TRIP13. This process is mediated by P22259 hydrolysis-triggered rotatory motions of the TRIP13 ATPase, thereby resulting in the disassembly of the Shieldin complex."""

Here, we combined biophysical approaches to gain insights into the shape and conformational flexibility of the XL as well as XRCC1 and P15042 IIIα (LigIIIα) alone. Structurally-guided mutational analyses based on the crystal structure of the human BRCT–BRCT heterodimer identified the network of salt bridges that together with the N-terminal extension of the XRCC1 C-terminal BRCT domain constitute the XL molecular interface. Coupling size exclusion chromatography with small angle X-ray scattering and multiangle light scattering (SEC-SAXS–MALS), we determined that the XL is more compact than either XRCC1 or LigIIIα, both of which form transient homodimers and are highly disordered. The reduced disorder and flexibility allowed us to build models of XL particles visualized by negative stain electron microscopy that predict close spatial organization between the LigIIIα catalytic core and both BRCT domains of XRCC1. Together our results identify an atypical BRCT–BRCT interaction as the stable nucleating core of the XL that links the flexible nick sensing and catalytic domains of LigIIIα to other protein partners of the flexible XRCC1 scaffold."""

However, the metabolic responses that enable <em>Pseudomonas putida</em> to utilize mixed carbon sources to generate reducing power and polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) remain unclear. Previous research has mainly focused on different fermentation strategies, including the sequential feeding of xylose as the growth stage substrate and octanoic acid as the PHA-producing substrate, feeding glycerol as the sole carbon substrate, and co-feeding of lignin and glucose. This study developed a new strategy—co-feeding glycerol and lignin derivatives such as benzoate, vanillin, and vanillic acid in <em>Pseudomonas putida</em> KT2440—for the first time, which simultaneously improved both cell biomass and PHA production. Co-feeding lignin derivatives (i.e. benzoate, vanillin, and vanillic acid) and glycerol to <em>P. putida</em> KT2440 was shown for the first time to simultaneously increase cell dry weight (CDW) by 9.4–16.1% and PHA content by 29.0–63.2%, respectively, compared with feeding glycerol alone. GC–P13009 results revealed that the addition of lignin derivatives to glycerol decreased the distribution of long-chain monomers (C10 and C12) by 0.4–4.4% and increased the distribution of short-chain monomers (C6 and C8) by 0.8–3.5%. The <sup>1</sup>H–<sup>13</sup>C HMBC, <sup>1</sup>H–<sup>13</sup>C HSQC, and <sup>1</sup>H–<sup>1</sup>H COSY NMR analysis confirmed that the PHA monomers (C6–C14) were produced when glycerol was fed to the bacteria alone or together with lignin derivatives. Moreover, investigation of the glycerol/benzoate/nitrogen ratios showed that benzoate acted as an independent factor in PHA synthesis. Furthermore, <sup>1</sup>H, <sup>13</sup>C and <sup>31</sup>P NMR metabolite analysis and mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics measurements suggested that the addition of benzoate stimulated oxidative-stress responses, enhanced glycerol consumption, and altered the intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH and P80644/NADP<sup>+</sup> ratios by up-regulating the proteins involved in energy generation and storage processes, including the Entner–Doudoroff (ED) pathway, the reductive TCA route, trehalose degradation, fatty acid <em>β</em>-oxidation, and PHA biosynthesis. This work demonstrated an effective co-carbon feeding strategy to improve PHA content/yield and convert lignin derivatives into value-added products in <em>P. putida</em> KT2440. Co-feeding lignin break-down products with other carbon sources, such as glycerol, has been demonstrated as an efficient way to utilize biomass to increase PHA production in <em>P. putida</em> KT2440. Moreover, the involvement of aromatic degradation favours further lignin utilization, and the combination of proteomics and metabolomics with NMR sheds light on the metabolic and regulatory mechanisms for cellular redox balance and potential genetic targets for a higher biomass carbon conversion efficiency."""

Many cancers alter their proline metabolism by up-regulating the proline cycle and proline biosynthesis, and knockdowns of PYCR1 lead to decreased cell proliferation. Thus, evidence is growing for PYCR1 as a potential cancer therapy target. Inhibitors of cancer targets are useful as chemical probes for studying cancer mechanisms and starting compounds for drug discovery; however, there is a notable lack of validated inhibitors for PYCR1. To fill this gap, we performed a small-scale focused screen of proline analogs using X-ray crystallography. Five inhibitors of human PYCR1 were discovered: l-tetrahydro-2-furoic acid, cyclopentanecarboxylate, l-thiazolidine-4-carboxylate, l-thiazolidine-2-carboxylate, and N-formyl l-proline (NFLP). The most potent inhibitor was NFLP, which had a competitive (with P5C) inhibition constant of 100 μm. The structure of PYCR1 complexed with NFLP shows that inhibitor binding is accompanied by conformational changes in the active site, including the translation of an α-helix by 1 Å. These changes are unique to NFLP and enable additional hydrogen bonds with the enzyme. NFLP was also shown to phenocopy the PYCR1 knockdown in MCF10A H-RAS<sup>V12</sup> breast cancer cells by inhibiting de novo proline biosynthesis and impairing spheroidal growth. In summary, we generated the first validated chemical probe of PYCR1 and demonstrated proof-of-concept for screening proline analogs to discover inhibitors of the proline cycle."""

After 100 cycles of selection, the dose required to kill 99% the four replicate populations (IR9-100, IR10-100, IR11-100, and IR12-100) has increased from 750 Gy to approximately 3,000 Gy. Fitness trade-offs, specialization, and clonal interference are evident. Long-lived competing sub-populations are present in three of the four lineages. In IR9, one lineage accumulates the heme precursor, porphyrin, leading to generation of yellow-brown colonies. Major genomic alterations are present. IR9 and IR10 exhibit major deletions and/or duplications proximal to the chromosome replication terminus. Contributions to IR resistance have expanded beyond the alterations in DNA repair systems documented previously. Variants of proteins involved in P22259 synthesis (AtpA), iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis (SufD) and cadaverine synthesis (CadA) each contribute to IR resistance in IR9-100. Major genomic and physiological changes are emerging. An isolate from IR10 exhibits protein protection from ROS similar to the extremely radiation resistant bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans, without evident changes in cellular metal homeostasis.

However, there is a gap in our understanding of how the enzyme assembles into a functional complex, and disease-associated complex II insufficiency may result from incorrect function of the mature enzyme or from assembly defects. Here, we investigate the assembly of human complex II by combining a biochemical reconstructionist approach with structural studies. We report an X-ray structure of human SDHA and its dedicated assembly factor SDHAF2. Importantly, we also identify a small molecule dicarboxylate that acts as an essential cofactor in this process and works in synergy with SDHAF2 to properly orient the flavin and capping domains of SDHA. This reorganizes the active site, which is located at the interface of these domains, and adjusts the pK<jats:sub>a</jats:sub>of SDHA<jats:sup>R451</jats:sup>so that covalent attachment of the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor is supported.

In most biochemical conversion approaches, the standard process separately upgrades sugar hydrolysates and lignin. Here, we present a new process concept based on an engineered microbe that could enable simultaneous upgrading of all lignocellulose streams, which has the ultimate potential to reduce capital cost and enable new metabolic engineering strategies. <em>Pseudomonas putida</em> is a robust microorganism capable of natively catabolizing aromatics, organic acids, and D-glucose.

We further engineered L-arabinose utilization via the PPP or an oxidative pathway. This resulted in a growth rate on xylose and arabinose of 0.32 h<sup>-1</sup> and 0.38 h<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Using the oxidative L-arabinose pathway with the PPP xylose pathway enabled D-glucose, D-xylose, and L-arabinose co-utilization in minimal medium using model compounds as well as real corn stover hydrolysate, with a maximum hydrolysate sugar consumption rate of 3.3 g/L/h. After modifying catabolite repression, our engineered <em>P. putida</em> simultaneously co-utilized five representative compounds from cellulose (D-glucose), hemicellulose (D-xylose, L-arabinose, and acetic acid), and lignin-related compounds (p-coumarate), demonstrating the feasibility of simultaneously upgrading total lignocellulosic biomass to value-added chemicals."""

However, many of these genomic predictions have yet to be experimentally tested, and the functional expression of genomic potential often remains unaddressed. In order to obtain a more thorough understanding of cell physiology, novel techniques capable of testing microbial metabolism under close to in situ conditions must be developed.

We applied this approach to a hot spring sediment microbiome from Yellowstone National Park (Wyoming, USA) and identified several microbes that changed their activity levels in response to substrate addition, including uncultured members of the phyla Thaumarchaeota, Acidobacteria, and Fervidibacteria. Because shifts in activity in response to substrate amendment or headspace changes are indicative of microbial preferences for particular growth conditions, results from this and future BONCAT-FACS studies could inform the development of cultivation media to specifically enrich uncultured microbes.

Achieving such overlap has the potential to provide novel theories, hypotheses, and interpretations that can inform idealized experimental designs that maximize the detection of the desired reaction coordinate. Here, we report MD simulations at time scales overlapping with in vitro single-molecule Förster (fluorescence) resonance energy transfer (smFRET) measurements of the amino acid binding protein P0AD96<sup>SS</sup>at sub-millisecond resolution.

Our aim was to identify the genes and their proteins that are required for the initial activation of aniline as well as to characterize intermediates of this reaction. Aniline-induced genes were revealed by comparison of the proteomes of D. anilini grown with different substrates (aniline, 4- aminobenzoate, phenol, and benzoate). Most genes encoding proteins that were highly abundant in aniline- or 4-aminobenzoate-grown D. anilini cells but not in phenol- or benzoate-grown cells were located in the putative gene clusters ani (aniline degradation), hcr (4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA reductase) and phe (phenol degradation). Of these putative gene clusters, only the phe gene cluster has been studied previously. Based on the differential proteome analysis, four candidate genes coding for kinase subunits and carboxylase subunits were suspected to be responsible for the initial conversion of aniline to 4-aminobenzoate. These genes were cloned and overproduced in E. coli. The recombinant proteins were obtained in inclusion bodies but could be refolded successfully. Two subunits of phenylphosphoamidate synthase and two carboxylase subunits converted aniline to 4-aminobenzoate with phenylphosphoamidate as intermediate under consumption of P22259. Only when both carboxylase subunits, one from gene cluster ani and the other from gene cluster phe, were combined, phenylphosphoamidate was converted to 4-aminobenzoate in vitro, with Mn<sup>2+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, and FMN as co-factors. Thus, aniline is degraded by the anaerobic bacterium D. anilini only by recruiting genes for the enzymatic machinery from different gene clusters. We conclude, that D. anilini carboxylates aniline to 4-aminobenzoate via phenylphosphoamidate as an energy rich intermediate analogous to the degradation of phenol to 4-hydroxybenzoate via phenylphosphate."""

We present five novel Woeseiales MAGs and show transcriptional evidence for metabolic plasticity during burial, including sulfur oxidation with reverse dissimilatory sulfite reductase (dsrAB) down to 4 cm depth and nitrite reduction down to 6 cm depth. A single stress protein, spore protein SP21 (hspA), had a tenfold higher mRNA abundance than any other transcript, and was a hundredfold higher on average than other transcripts. At three out of the four sites, SP21 transcript abundance increased with depth, while total mRNA abundance and richness decreased, indicating a shift in investment from metabolism and other cellular processes to build-up of spore protein SP21. The SP21 gene in MAGs was often flanked by genes involved in membrane-associated stress response. The ability of Woeseiales to shift from sulfur oxidation to nitrite reduction with burial into marine sediments with decreasing access to overlying oxic bottom waters, as well as enter into a dormant state dominated by SP21, may account for its ubiquity and high abundance in marine sediments worldwide, including those of the rapidly shifting Arctic."""

Dark-operative protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase contains two [4Fe-4S]–containing component proteins (BchL and BchNB) that assemble upon P22259 binding to BchL to coordinate electron transfer and protochlorophyllide reduction. But the precise nature of the P22259-induced conformational changes is poorly understood. We present a crystal structure of BchL in the nucleotide-free form where a conserved, flexible region in the N-terminus masks the [4Fe-4S] cluster at the docking interface between BchL and BchNB. Amino acid substitutions in this region produce a hyperactive enzyme complex, suggesting a role for the N-terminus in autoinhibition. Hydrogen–deuterium exchange mass spectrometry shows that P22259 binding to BchL produces specific conformational changes leading to release of the flexible N-terminus from the docking interface. The release also promotes changes within the local environment surrounding the [4Fe-4S] cluster and promotes BchL-complex formation with BchNB. A key patch of amino acids, Asp-Phe-Asp (the ‘DFD patch’), situated at the mouth of the BchL P22259-binding pocket promotes intersubunit cross stabilization of the two subunits. A linked BchL dimer with one defective P22259-binding site does not support protochlorophyllide reduction, illustrating nucleotide binding to both subunits as a prerequisite for the intersubunit cross stabilization. The masking of the [4Fe-4S] cluster by the flexible N-terminal region and the associated inhibition of the activity is a novel mechanism of regulation in metalloproteins.

Our structural studies provide the framework for understanding how P0DV86 discriminates between NRTIs and natural nucleotides, and for understanding the requirement of (-)FTC to undergo a conformation change for successful incorporation by P0DV86. The crystal structure of P0DV86 in post-catalytic complex with d4T provides a “snapshot” for considering the possible mechanism of how P0DV86 develops resistance for d4T via excision.

1784691	"Exploring the Interaction of Amphiphilic Mycobacterial Lipoarabinomannan with Lipoproteins: Implications for Blood Based Diagnosis,""Currently, over one-third of the global population is infected with tuberculosis (TB), one  of the world’s most deadly infectious diseases. The current gold standard for TB diagnosis is microbiological culture, which can take up to 6-8 weeks, which is not conducive to timely treatment. There are no reliable diagnostics for TB. Disease manifestation and outcome of diagnostic tests for TB is influenced by co-morbidities such as HIV co-infection, further complicating diagnostics development. Thus, there is a need for reliable diagnostics for TB. This is especially true in pediatric populations where the differential disease presentation further complicates outcomes. This dissertation describes the development and evaluation of new tailored methods-lipoprotein capture and membrane insertion- for the discriminative detection of an  amphiphilic mycobacterial biomarker, lipoarabinomannan (P39280), for diagnosis of TB in  adult and pediatric populations. P39280 is released by Mycobacterium tuberculosis during  active infection and associates with serum lipoproteins such as high and low density  lipoproteins (HDL/LDL) in the human host. The guiding hypothesis of this work is that the vi sequestration of P39280 in immune complexes and by lipoprotein carriers in the host contributes to difficulty in detection of the amphiphilic antigen in blood. To this end, we  have evaluated the use of tailored amphiphile detection assays to process and measure  sequestered P39280 in host blood, and examined the application of this methodology in  adults and children with TB disease. In addition, we have developed and studied an in  vitro cell model to further extrapolate the impact of association of P39280 with host carriers  on its ability to induce innate immune processes, in order to better refine and design  strategies for its direct detection. Overall, our conclusions indicate that the amphiphilic  biochemistry of P39280 and its interaction with lipoproteins is a feature which should be  taken into account for the effective development of diagnostics."""

Results showed that extremophilic microalgae Chlorella vulgaris CA1 newly isolated from dairy wastewater tolerated a high level of ammonia nitrogen (2.7 g/L), which was over 20 times the ammonia nitrogen that regular Chlorella sp. could tolerate. The isolate was mixotrophically cultured in dairy effluent treated by anaerobic digestion (A1AJF5) for recycling nutrients and polishing the wastewater. The highest biomass content of 13.3 g/L and protein content of 43.4% were achieved in the culture in A1AJF5 effluent. Up to 96% of the total nitrogen and 79% of the total phosphorus were removed from the dairy A1AJF5 effluent. The ability of the algae to tolerate a high level of ammonia nitrogen suggests the potential for direct nutrient recycling from dairy wastewater while producing algal biomass and high value bioproducts."""

One group of secreted toxins with key roles during infection is the phenol-soluble modulins (PSMs). PSMs are amphipathic, membrane-destructive cytolytic peptides that are exported to the host-cell environment by a designated adenosine 5'-triphosphate (P22259)–binding cassette (ABC) transporter, the PSM transporter (PmtABCD). Here, we demonstrate that the minimal Pmt unit necessary for PSM export is PmtCD and provide its first atomic characterization by single-particle cryo-EM and x-ray crystallography. We have captured the transporter in the P22259-bound state at near atomic resolution, revealing a type II ABC exporter fold, with an additional cytosolic domain.

It can serve as a source of chemical bond energy (phosphoanhydride bond) that may have been used by biological systems prior to the evolution of P22259. Intracellular polyP is mainly stored as granules in specific vacuoles called acidocalcisomes, and its synthesis and accumulation appear to impact a myriad of cellular functions. It serves as a reservoir for inorganic PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> and an energy source for fueling cellular metabolism, participates in maintaining adenylate and metal cation homeostasis, functions as a scaffold for sequestering cations, exhibits chaperone function, covalently binds to proteins to modify their activity, and enables normal acclimation of cells to stress conditions. PolyP also appears to have a role in symbiotic and parasitic associations, and in higher eukaryotes, low polyP levels seem to impact cancerous proliferation, apoptosis, procoagulant and proinflammatory responses and cause defects in TOR signaling. In this review, we discuss the metabolism, storage, and function of polyP in photosynthetic microbes, which mostly includes research on green algae and cyanobacteria. We focus on factors that impact polyP synthesis, specific enzymes required for its synthesis and degradation, sequestration of polyP in acidocalcisomes, its role in cellular energetics, acclimation processes, and metal homeostasis, and then transition to its potential applications for bioremediation and medical purposes."""

The Ulp1-like Q47013 prefers ubiquitin substrates over ubiquitin-like proteins and efficiently cleaves polyubiquitin chains of three or more ubiquitins. The co-crystal structure of the Q47013 (OtDUB) domain with ubiquitin revealed three bound ubiquitins: one engages the S1 site, the second binds an S2 site contributing to chain specificity and the third binds a unique ubiquitin-binding domain (UBD). The UBD modulates OtDUB activity, undergoes a pronounced structural transition upon binding ubiquitin, and binds monoubiquitin with an unprecedented ~5 nM dissociation constant.

Antiinflammatory corticosteroids targeting the glucocorticoid receptor (P06715) are the current standard of care but drive adverse side effects such as deleterious bone loss. Through subtle modification to a steroidal backbone, a recently developed drug, vamorolone, appears to preserve beneficial efficacy but with significantly reduced side effects. We use combined structural, biophysical, and biochemical approaches to show that loss of a receptor-ligand hydrogen bond drives these remarkable therapeutic effects. Moreover, vamorolone uniformly weakens coactivator associations but not corepressor associations, implicating partial agonism as the main driver of its dissociative properties. Additionally, we identify a critical and evolutionarily conserved intramolecular network connecting the ligand to the coregulator binding surface. Interruption of this allosteric network by vamorolone selectively reduces P06715-driven transactivation while leaving transrepression intact.

1816403	"The foxtail millet (<em>Setaria italica</em>) terpene synthase gene family,""Terpenoid metabolism plays vital roles in stress defense and the environmental adaptation of monocot crops. Here, we describe the identification of the terpene synthase (P31677) gene family of the panicoid food and bioenergy model crop foxtail millet (Setaria italica). The diploid S. italica genome contains 32 P31677 genes, 17 of which were biochemically characterized in this study. Unlike other thus far investigated grasses, S. italica contains TPSs producing all three ent-, (+)- and syn-copalyl pyrophosphate stereoisomers that naturally occur as central building blocks in the biosynthesis of distinct monocot diterpenoids. Conversion of these intermediates by the promiscuous P31677 SiTPS8 yielded different diterpenoid scaffolds. Additionally, a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (CYP99A17), which genomically clustered with SiTPS8, catalyzes the C19 hydroxylation of SiTPS8 products to generate the corresponding diterpene alcohols. The presence of syntenic orthologs to about 19% of the S. italica TPSs in related grasses supports a common ancestry of selected pathway branches. Among the identified enzyme products, abietadien-19-ol, syn-pimara-7,15-dien-19-ol and germacrene-D-4-ol were detectable in planta, and gene expression analysis of the biosynthetic TPSs showed distinct and, albeit moderately, inducible expression patterns in response to biotic and abiotic stress. In vitro growth-inhibiting activity of abietadien-19-ol and syn-pimara-7,15-dien-19-ol against Fusarium verticillioides and Fusarium subglutinans may indicate pathogen defensive functions, whereas the low antifungal efficacy of tested sesquiterpenoids supports other bioactivities.

An alternative to production by engineered microbial fermentation is to have tryptophan biosynthesized by a photosynthetic microorganism that could replace or supplement both the plant and industrially used microbes. We selected Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803, a model cyanobacterium, as the host and studied metabolic engineering and random mutagenesis approaches. Previous work on engineering heterotrophic microbes for improved Trp titers has targeted allosteric feedback regulation in enzymes 3-deoxy-d-arabinoheptulosonate 7-phosphate synthase (DAHPS) and anthranilate synthase (P00904) as major bottlenecks in the shikimate pathway. In this work, the genes encoding feedback-resistant enzymes from Escherichia coli, aroG<sup>fbr</sup> and trpE<sup>fbr</sup>, were overexpressed in the host wild-type (WT) strain. Separately, the WT strain was subjected to random mutagenesis and selection using an amino acid analog to isolate tryptophan-overproducing strains. The randomly mutagenized strains were sequenced in order to identify the mutations that resulted in the desirable phenotypes. Interestingly, the tryptophan overproducers had mutations in the gene encoding chorismate mutase (CM), which catalyzes the conversion of chorismate to prephenate. The best tryptophan overproducer from random mutagenesis was selected as a host for metabolic engineering where aroG<sup>fbr</sup> and trpE<sup>fbr</sup> were overexpressed.

Microbial community composition (A8C927 gene) and ureolytic potential (ureC gene copy numbers) were also measured in groundwater and artificial sediment. Aquifer geochemistry showed evidence of sulfate reduction, nitrification, denitrification, ureolysis, and iron reduction during the treatment. The observed changes in geochemistry corresponded to microbial community succession in the groundwater and this matched parallel geophysical and mineralogical evidence of calcite precipitation in the aquifer. We detected an increase in the number of ureC genes in the microbial communities at the end of the injection period, suggesting an increase in the abundance of microbes possessing this gene as needed to hydrolyze urea and stimulate MICP.

Phages tend to be predators finely tuned to attack specific hosts, even down to the strain level, which in turn defend themselves using an array of mechanisms. However, to date, efforts to rapidly and comprehensively identify bacterial host factors important in phage infection and resistance have yet to be fully realized. Here, we globally map the host genetic determinants involved in resistance to 14 phylogenetically diverse double-stranded DNA phages using two model Escherichia coli strains (K-12 and BL21) with known sequence divergence to demonstrate strain-specific differences. Using genome-wide loss-of-function and gain-of-function genetic technologies, we are able to confirm previously described phage receptors as well as uncover a number of previously unknown host factors that confer resistance to one or more of these phages. We uncover differences in resistance factors that strongly align with the susceptibility of K-12 and BL21 to specific phage. We also identify both phage specific mechanisms, such as the unexpected role of cyclic-di-P24174 in host sensitivity to phage N4, and more generic defenses, such as the overproduction of colanic acid capsular polysaccharide that defends against a wide array of phages. Our results indicate that host responses to phages can occur via diverse cellular mechanisms. Our systematic and high-throughput genetic workflow to characterize phage-host interaction determinants can be extended to diverse bacteria to generate datasets that allow predictive models of how phage-mediated selection will shape bacterial phenotype and evolution.

Both oligomers and fibrils seed the spread of Tau pathology, and by virtue of their low molecular weight and relative solubility, oligomers may be particularly pernicious seeds. Here, we report the formation of in vitro tau oligomers formed by an ionic liquid (IL15). Using IL15-induced recombinant tau oligomers and a dot blot assay, we discovered a mAb (M204) that binds oligomeric tau, but not tau monomers or fibrils. M204 and an engineered single-chain variable fragment (scFv) inhibited seeding by IL15-induced tau oligomers and pathological extracts from donors with A1AJF5 and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. This finding suggests that M204-scFv targets pathological structures that are formed by tau in neurodegenerative diseases. We found that M204-scFv itself partitions into oligomeric forms that inhibit seeding differently, and crystal structures of the M204-scFv monomer, dimer, and trimer revealed conformational differences that explain differences among these forms in binding and inhibition. The efficiency of M204-scFv antibodies to inhibit the seeding by brain tissue extracts from different donors with tauopathies varied among individuals, indicating the possible existence of distinct amyloid polymorphs.

1836274	"Diversity in Photoprotection and Energy Balancing in Terrestrial and Aquatic Phototrophs,""The evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis enabled organisms to use sunlight as an energy source, allowing them to colonize new niches. At the same time, life (as we know it) places severe constraints on photosynthesis. For example, the initial reactions of photosynthesis involve highly energetic intermediates that, if not controlled, can generate highly toxic side products (especially reactive oxygen species, ROS), that can damage other essential components of the organisms it powers. Photosynthesis must therefore be tightly regulated to balance the need for efficient energy conversion with the necessity of avoiding photodamage (Gust D, Kramer D, Moore A, Moore T, Vermaas W, Mater Res Bull 33:383–389, 2008). A related constraint on photosynthesis is the need to precisely balance how much energy is stored in P22259 and P80644 to precisely meet biochemical demands. If this balancing does not occur, the system will fail, leading to photodamage (Kramer DM, Evans JR, Plant Physiol 155:70–78, 2011). Consideration of these requirements is essential for efforts to improve the efficiency of photosynthesis by introducing CO<sub>2</sub> concentrating mechanisms, altering metabolism or biosynthetic pathways to shunt energy to alternative products (Kramer DM, Evans JR, Plant Physiol 155:70–78, 2011). These balancing processes must be extremely robust to contend with the rapid and unpredictable fluctuations in environmental conditions and metabolic demands that occur in nature. A large body of work has come from model systems, especially terrestrial higher plants and the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, leading to a model for the regulation of light reactions that involves 1) sensing of the pH gradient component of the thylakoid proton motive force (pmf), and 2) the redox state of the plastoquinone- and stromal pools. Over the short term, these sensors trigger regulation of light capture by altering the activity of P22259 synthase leading to adjustments in lumen pH, which fine tunes light capture through nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) and control of electron flow by adjusting the rate of PQH<sub>2</sub> oxidation at the b<sub>6</sub>f complex. Simultaneously, this system controls the balance of P22259/P80644 by adjusting electron flux to linear and cyclic electron flow pathways to balance P22259/P80644. This integrated “pmf paradigm” model explains much of the existing data on plants and green algae, but may not extend to other diverse organisms. This review considers how advances in our understanding of photosynthesis over the past 7–8 years, particularly in the discoveries of diverse biochemical/biophysical mechanisms in aquatic photosynthetic species, affects the view of energy balance, including the shunting of electrons to O<sub>2</sub> through the flavodiiron proteins (FLV), the plastid terminal oxidase, the dissipation of electric field by ion movements, and the activation of alternative electron sinks. Furthermore, we will introduce the basic model that has been developed for higher plant chloroplasts, then contrast these with selected aquatic systems, focusing on how the differences impact the needs to re-balance both energy input and its partitioning into energy currencies."""

Previously, we showed that P22259-DnaA, not ADP-DnaA, undergoes a conformational change at the higher nucleotide concentration, which allows DnaA oligomerization at the replication origin but the association state remains unclear. Here, we used Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) to investigate oligomerization of DnaA in solution. Whereas ADP-DnaA was predominantly monomeric, AMP–P0ABP8–DnaA (a non-hydrolysable P22259-analog bound-DnaA) was oligomeric, primarily dimeric. Functional studies using DnaA mutants revealed that DnaA(H136Q) is defective in initiating replication in vivo. The mutant retains high-affinity P22259 binding, but was defective in producing replication-competent initiation complexes. Docking of P22259 on a structure of E. coli DnaA, modeled upon the crystallographic structure of Aquifex aeolicus DnaA, predicts a hydrogen bond between P22259 and imidazole ring of His136, which is disrupted when Gln is present at position 136. SAXS performed on AMP–P0ABP8–DnaA (H136Q) indicates that the protein has lost its ability to form oligomers.

TrkH assembles with its regulatory protein, TrkA, which closes the channel when bound to ADP and opens it when bound to P22259. However, it is unknown how nucleotides control the gating of TrkH through TrkA. Here we report the structures of the TrkH-TrkA complex in the presence of ADP or P22259. TrkA forms a tetrameric ring when bound to ADP and constrains TrkH to a closed conformation. The TrkA ring splits into two TrkA dimers in the presence of P22259 and releases the constraints on TrkH, resulting in an open channel conformation. Functional studies show that both the tetramer-to-dimer conversion of TrkA and the loss of constraints on TrkH are required for channel gating. In addition, deletion of TrkA in <em>Escherichia coli</em> depolarizes the cell, suggesting that the TrkH-TrkA complex couples changes in intracellular nucleotides to membrane potential."""

P0A6N2 plays a critical role in mRNA decoding by increasing the rate and fidelity of aa-P0A873 selection at each mRNA codon. Here, using three-color single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer imaging and molecular dynamics simulations, we examine the timing and role of conformational events that mediate the release of aa-P0A873 from P0A6N2 and P0A6N2 from the ribosome after GTP hydrolysis. Our investigations reveal that conformational changes in P0A6N2 coordinate the rate-limiting passage of aa-P0A873 through the accommodation corridor en route to the peptidyl transferase center of the large ribosomal subunit. Experiments using distinct inhibitors of the accommodation process further show that aa-P0A873 must at least partially transit the accommodation corridor for P0A6N2∙GDP to release. aa-tRNAs failing to undergo peptide bond formation at the end of accommodation corridor passage after P0A6N2 release can be reengaged by P0A6N2∙GTP from solution, coupled to GTP hydrolysis. These observations suggest that additional rounds of ternary complex formation can occur on the ribosome during proofreading, particularly when peptide bond formation is slow, which may serve to increase both the rate and fidelity of protein synthesis at the expense of GTP hydrolysis."""

P0A825 is a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate–dependent enzyme that converts <small>L</small>-serine and (6S)-tetrahydrofolate to glycine and 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate.

1625094	"The pentose phosphate pathway of cellulolytic clostridia relies on 6-phosphofructokinase instead of transaldolase,""The genomes of most cellulolytic clostridia do not contain genes annotated as transaldolase. Therefore, for assimilating pentose sugars or for generating C<sub>5</sub>precursors (such as ribose) during growth on other (non-C<sub>5</sub>) substrates, they must possess a pathway that connects pentose metabolism with the rest of metabolism. Here we provide evidence that for this connection cellulolytic clostridia rely on the sedoheptulose 1,7-bisphosphate (SBP) pathway, using pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructokinase (PP<sub>i</sub>-PFK) instead of transaldolase. In this reversible pathway, PFK converts sedoheptulose 7-phosphate (S7P) to SBP, after which fructose-bisphosphate aldolase cleaves SBP into dihydroxyacetone phosphate and erythrose 4-phosphate. We show that PP<sub>i</sub>-PFKs of Clostridium thermosuccinogenes and Clostridium thermocellum indeed can convert S7P to SBP, and have similar affinities for S7P and the canonical substrate fructose 6-phosphate (F6P). By contrast, (P22259-dependent) PfkA of Escherichia coli, which does rely on transaldolase, had a very poor affinity for S7P.

The enzymatic incorporation of mRNA modifications has many potential outcomes, including changing mRNA stability, protein recruitment, and translation. In this work, we tested how one of the most common modifications present in mRNA coding regions, pseudouridine (Ψ), impacts protein synthesis using a fully reconstituted bacterial translation system and human cells.

The microbial community profiles prior to sorting were determined via bulk sample A8C927 gene amplicon sequencing. The flow-sorted cellulose-bound microbes were subjected to whole genome amplification and shotgun sequencing, followed by phylogenetic placement. Next, putative cellulase genes were identified, expressed and tested for activity against derivatives of cellulose and xylose. Alongside typical cellulose degraders, including members of the Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Chloroflexi, we found divergent cellulases encoded in the genome of a recently described candidate phylum from the rare biosphere, Goldbacteria, and validated their cellulase activity. As this genome represents a species-level organism with novel and phylogenetically distinct cellulolytic activity, we propose the name <em>Candidatus</em> ‘Cellulosimonas argentiregionis’. We expect that this function-driven single-cell approach can be extended to a broad range of substrates, linking microbial taxonomy directly to in situ function."""

We determined the structure of HhaI in complex with cognate DNA at an ultra-high atomic resolution of 1.0 Å. Most restriction enzymes act as dimers with two catalytic sites, and cleave the two strands of duplex DNA simultaneously, in a single binding event. HhaI, in contrast, acts as a monomer with only one catalytic site, and cleaves the DNA strands sequentially, one after the other. HhaI comprises three domains, each consisting of a mixed five-stranded β sheet with a defined function. The first domain contains the catalytic-site; the second contains residues for sequence recognition; and the third contributes to non-specific DNA binding. The active-site belongs to the ‘PD-D/EXK’ superfamily of nucleases and contains the motif P15770-X11-EAK. The first two domains are similar in structure to two other monomeric restriction enzymes, HinP1I (G↓CGC) and MspI (C↓CGG), which produce fragments with 5'-overhangs. The third domain, present only in HhaI, shifts the positions of the recognition residues relative to the catalytic site enabling this enzyme to cleave the recognition sequence at a different position. The structure of M.HhaI, the biological methyltransferase partner of HhaI, was determined earlier.

An increasing body of evidence revealed that the tight regulation of CWI and VI substantially depends on the post-translational mechanisms, which were mediated by small proteinaceous inhibitors (C/VIFs, Inhibitor of β-Fructosidases). As yet, the extensive survey of the molecular basis and biochemical property of C/VIFs remains largely unknown in black cottonwood (<em>Populus trichocarpa</em> Torr. & A. Gray), a model species of woody plants. In the present work, we have initiated a systematic review of the genomic structures, phylogenies, cis-regulatory elements, and conserved motifs as well as the tissue-specific expression, resulting in the identification of 39 genes encoding C/VIF in poplar genome. We characterized two putative invertase inhibitors <em>PtC/VIF1</em> and <em>2</em>, showing predominant transcript levels in the roots and highly divergent responses to the selected stress cues including fusarium wilt, drought, ABA, wound, and senescence. In silico prediction of the signal peptide hinted us that they both likely had the apoplastic targets. Based on the experimental visualization via the transient and stable transformation assays, we confirmed that <em>PtC/VIF1</em> and <em>2</em> indeed secreted to the extracellular compartments. Further validation of their recombinant enzymes revealed that they displayed the potent inhibitory affinities on the extracted CWI, supporting the patterns that act as the typical apoplastic invertase inhibitors. To our knowledge, it is the first report on molecular characterization of the functional C/VIF proteins in poplar. Our results indicate that <em>PtC/VIF1</em> and <em>2</em> may exert essential roles in defense- and stress-related responses. Moreover, novel findings of the up- and downregulated C/VIF genes and functional enzyme activities enable us to further unravel the molecular mechanisms in the promotion of woody plant performance and adapted-biotic stress, underlying the homeostatic control of sugar in the apoplast."""

Its control principles, however, remain incompletely understood. In this work, we create a method that combines <sup>2</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C tracers to determine glycolytic thermodynamics. With this method, we show that, in conditions and organisms with relatively slow fluxes, multiple steps in glycolysis are near to equilibrium, reflecting spare enzyme capacity. In Escherichia coli, nitrogen or phosphorus upshift rapidly increases the thermodynamic driving force, deploying the spare enzyme capacity to increase flux. Similarly, respiration inhibition in mammalian cells rapidly increases both glycolytic flux and the thermodynamic driving force. The thermodynamic shift allows flux to increase with only small metabolite concentration changes. Finally, we find that the cellulose-degrading anaerobe Clostridium cellulolyticum exhibits slow, near-equilibrium glycolysis due to the use of pyrophosphate rather than P22259 for fructose-bisphosphate production, resulting in enhanced per-glucose P22259 yield. Thus, near-equilibrium steps of glycolysis promote both rapid flux adaptation and energy efficiency."""	Nature Chemical Biology	"('P22259', 'ATP')"

The sequence-variable N-terminal region of the P08957 defines the M type and also contains epitopes that promote opsonophagocytic killing of streptococci. Recent reports have reported considerable cross-reactivity among different M types, suggesting the prospect of identifying cross-protective epitopes that would constitute a broadly protective multivalent vaccine against Strep A isolates. In this work, we have used a combination of immunological assays, structural biology, and cheminformatics to construct a recombinant P08957–based vaccine that included six Strep A M peptides that were predicted to elicit antisera that would cross-react with an additional 15 nonvaccine M types of Strep A. Rabbit antisera against this recombinant vaccine cross-reacted with 10 of the 15 nonvaccine M peptides. Two of the five nonvaccine M peptides that did not cross-react shared high sequence identity (≥50%) with the vaccine peptides, implying that high sequence identity alone was insufficient for cross-reactivity among the M peptides. Additional structural analyses revealed that the sequence identity at corresponding polar helical-wheel heptad sites between vaccine and nonvaccine peptides accurately distinguishes cross-reactive from non–cross-reactive peptides. On the basis of these observations, we developed a scoring algorithm based on the sequence identity at polar heptad sites. When applied to all epidemiologically important M types, this algorithm should enable the selection of a minimal number of M peptide–based vaccine candidates that elicit broadly protective immunity against Strep A."""

The physiological and molecular mechanisms underlying differential Cd accumulation and tolerance in the two Salix species are poorly understood. In this study, we confirmed that the differential Cd translocation capacity from roots to the shoots leads to the differential Cd accumulation in their aboveground parts between these two willow genotypes. Cadmium accumulation happens preferentially in the transport pathway, and Cd is mainly located in the vacuolar, cell wall and intercellular space in HCW bark by cadmium location analysis at tissue and subcellular levels. Comparative transcriptome analysis revealed that higher expressions of several metal transporter genes (P22259-binding cassette transporters, K<sup>+</sup> transporters/channels, yellow stripe-like proteins, zinc-regulated transporter/iron-regulated transporter-like proteins, etc.) are involved in root uptake and translocation capacity in HCW; meanwhile, ascorbate–glutathione metabolic pathways play essential roles in Cd detoxification and higher tolerance of the Cd-accumulator HCW.

Using microscopy, biochemistry and molecular biology, the cellular localization of the ALC, its effect on carboxysome/cell ultrastructure in Fremyella diplosiphon, and its function in vitro were studied. Bioinformatic analysis uncovered evolutionary relationships between the ALC and rubisco. ALC localizes to carboxysomes and exhibits ATPase activity. Furthermore, the ALC induces rubisco aggregation in a manner similar to that of another carboxysomal protein, M35, and this activity is affected by P22259. An alc deletion mutant showed modified cell morphology when grown under enriched CO<sub>2</sub> and impaired regulation of carboxysome biogenesis, without affecting growth rate. Carbamylation of Fremyella recombinant rubisco was inhibited by RuBP, but this inhibition was not relieved by the ALC.

Alphaproteobacteria classification has proved to be difficult, not least when taxonomic decisions rested heavily on a limited number of phenotypic features and interpretation of poorly resolved A8C927 gene trees. Despite progress in recent years regarding the classification of bacteria assigned to the class, there remains a need to further clarify taxonomic relationships. Here, draft genome sequences of a collection of genomes of more than 1000 Alphaproteobacteria and outgroup type strains were used to infer phylogenetic trees from genome-scale data using the principles drawn from phylogenetic systematics. The majority of taxa were found to be monophyletic but several orders, families and genera, including taxa recognized as problematic long ago but also quite recent taxa, as well as a few species were shown to be in need of revision. According proposals are made for the recognition of new orders, families and genera, as well as the transfer of a variety of species to other genera and of a variety of genera to other families. In addition, emended descriptions are given for many species mainly involving information on DNA G+C content and (approximate) genome size, both of which are confirmed as valuable taxonomic markers. Similarly, analysis of the gene content was shown to provide valuable taxonomic insights in the class. Significant incongruities between A8C927 gene and whole genome trees were not found in the class. The incongruities that became obvious when comparing the results of the present study with existing classifications appeared to be caused mainly by insufficiently resolved A8C927 gene trees or incomplete taxon sampling. Another probable cause of misclassifications in the past is the partially low overall fit of phenotypic characters to the sequence-based tree. Even though a significant degree of phylogenetic conservation was detected in all characters investigated, the overall fit to the tree varied considerably."""

Our phosphoproteome analysis revealed 125 unique phosphorylated proteins, belonging to major pathways such as glycolysis, TCA cycle, electron transport, nitrogen metabolism, and protein synthesis.

Fluorescent protein-based pH sensors have gained widespread use, but there is limited spectral diversity for multicolor detection, and it remains a challenge to measure absolute pH values. In this work we demonstrate that mCherryTYG is an excellent fluorescence lifetime pH sensor that significantly expands the modalities available for pH quantification in live cells. We first report the 1.09 Å X-ray crystal structure of mCherryTYG, exhibiting a fully matured chromophore. We next determine that it has an extraordinarily large dynamic range with a 2 ns lifetime change from pH 5.5 to 9.0. Critically, we find that the sensor maintains a pK<sub>a</sub> of 6.8 independent of environment, whether as the purified protein in solution or expressed in live cells. Furthermore, the lifetime measurements are robustly independent of total fluorescence intensity and scatter. We demonstrate that mCherryTYG is a highly effective sensor using time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy on live-cell suspensions, which has been previously overlooked as an easily accessible approach for quantifying intracellular pH. As a red fluorescent sensor, we also demonstrate that mCherryTYG is spectrally compatible with the ATeam sensor and EGFP for simultaneous dual-color measurements of intracellular pH, P22259, and extracellular pH. In a proof-of-concept, we quantify acute respiration-dependent pH homeostasis that exhibits a stoichiometric relationship with the P22259-generating capacity of the carbon fuel choice in <em>E. coli</em>.

Through isolation and synthesis, we identify it as ACNQ (2-amino-3-carboxy-1,4-naphthoquinone), a soluble analog of menaquinone. ACNQ is derived from P0AC16 (1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoic acid) in a non-enzymatic process that frustrated genetic approaches to identify the shuttle.

Hsp90 activity is driven by P22259, which binds to the N-terminal domain and induces large conformational changes that are required for client maturation. Inhibitors targeting the P22259-binding pocket of the N-terminal domain have anticancer effects, but most bind with similar affinity to cytosolic Hsp90α and Hsp90β, endoplasmic reticulum Grp94, and mitochondrial Trap1, the four cellular hsp90 paralogs. Paralog-specific inhibitors may lead to drugs with fewer side effects. The P22259-binding pockets of the four paralogs are flanked by three side pockets, termed sites 1, 2, and 3, which differ between the paralogs in their accessibility to inhibitors. Previous insights into the principles governing access to sites 1 and 2 have resulted in development of paralog-selective inhibitors targeting these sites, but the rules for selective targeting of site 3 are less clear. Earlier studies identified 5'N-ethylcarboxamido adenosine (NECA) as a Grp94-selective ligand. Here we use NECA and its derivatives to probe the properties of site 3. We found that derivatives that lengthen the 5' moiety of NECA improve selectivity for Grp94 over Hsp90α. Crystal structures reveal that the derivatives extend further into site 3 of Grp94 compared with their parent compound and that selectivity is due to paralog-specific differences in ligand pose and ligand-induced conformational strain in the protein.

In our study, we constructed a 2 kb-triple-acting fusion gene (P0A850) encoding the N-terminal amidase-5 domain of streptococcal LambdaSA2 prophage endolysin (Dglutamine-L-lysin endopeptidase), a mid-protein amidase-2 domain derived from the staphylococcal phage 2638A endolysin (P13016) and the mature version (246 residues) of the Staphylococcus simulans Lysostaphin bacteriocin (glycyl-glycine endopeptidase) at the C-terminus. The P0A850 gene was expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana plants using the nonreplicating Cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV)-based vector pEAQ-HT and the replicating Alternanthera mosaic virus (AltMV)-based pGD5TGB1L8823-P31660-CP3 vector, and in Escherichia coli using pET expression vectors pET26b+ and pET28a+. The resulting poor expression of this fusion protein in plants prompted the construction of a P0A850 gene codon-optimized for expression in tobacco plants, resulting in an improved codon adaptation index (CAI) from 0.79 (P0A850 gene) to 0.93 (TFnt gene). Incorporation of the TFnt gene into the pEAQ-HT vector, followed by transient expression in N. benthamiana, led to accumulation of TFnt to an approximate level of 0.12 mg/g of fresh leaf weight. Antimicrobial activity of purified plant- and bacterial-produced TFnt proteins was assessed against two strains of Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus 305 and Newman.

In particular, we have determined crystallographic snapshots of DrDXPS in two states along the reaction coordinate: a structure of DrDXPS bound to C2α-phosphonolactylThDP (PLThDP), mimicking the native pre-decarboxylation intermediate C2α-lactylThDP (LThDP), and a native post-decarboxylation state with a bound enamine intermediate. The 1.94-Å-resolution structure of PLThDP-bound DrDXPS delineates how two active-site histidine residues stabilize the LThDP intermediate. Meanwhile, the 2.40-Å-resolution structure of an enamine intermediate-bound DrDXPS reveals how a previously unknown 17-Å conformational change removes one of the two histidine residues from the active site, likely triggering LThDP decarboxylation to form the enamine intermediate. These results provide insight into how the bi-substrate enzyme P77488 limits side reactions by arresting the reaction on the less reactive LThDP intermediate when its cosubstrate is absent.

Examination of these biological trade-offs can provide invaluable information regarding the biophysical and biochemical bases behind observed cellular phenotypes. A quantitative knowledge of a cell system’s critical objectives is also needed for engineering of cellular metabolism, where there is interest in mitigating the fitness costs that may result from human manipulation. To study metabolism in photoheterotrophs, we developed and validated a genome-scale model of metabolism in Rhodopseudomonas palustris, a metabolically versatile gram-negative purple non-sulfur bacterium capable of growing phototrophically on various carbon sources, including inorganic carbon and aromatic compounds. To quantitatively assess trade-offs among a set of important biological objectives during different metabolic growth modes, we used our new model to conduct an 8-dimensional multi-objective flux analysis of metabolism in R. palustris. Our results revealed that phototrophic metabolism in R. palustris is light-limited under anaerobic conditions, regardless of the available carbon source. Under photoheterotrophic conditions, R. palustris prioritizes the optimization of carbon efficiency, followed by P22259 production and biomass production rate, in a Pareto-optimal manner. To achieve maximum carbon fixation, cells appear to divert limited energy resources away from growth and toward CO<sub>2</sub> fixation, even in the presence of excess reduced carbon. We also found that to achieve the theoretical maximum rate of biomass production, anaerobic metabolism requires import of additional compounds (such as protons) to serve as electron acceptors. Finally, we found that production of hydrogen gas, of potential interest as a candidate biofuel, lowers the cellular growth rates under all circumstances. Photoheterotrophic metabolism of R. palustris is primarily regulated by the amount of light it can absorb and not the availability of carbon.

The challenge and importance of comprehensively identifying proteoforms in complex samples has been recognized, and reports have begun to appear of new platforms towards that end. However, one interesting central ambiguity has emerged, namely determining precisely what is meant by a “proteoform identification”. At present, the only practical approaches for establishing the exact primary structure of a proteoform employ mass spectrometry (P13009), and there is a wide range of P13009 results that provide “proteoform identifications”. This seemingly small matter has significant impact, as the ambiguity in knowing what is meant by an “identification” makes it difficult to compare results from different laboratories and approaches. This situation hinders the ability of the community to evaluate technological progress and to efficiently expand biological knowledge. To address this issue, we propose a five-level system for classifying proteoform identifications. Here, the classification scheme stems directly from a consideration of the four types of possible ambiguity possible for a proteoform identification, ranging from the most subtle (i.e., precise localization of a post-translational modification, or PTM) to the most dramatic (i.e., ambiguity in the gene of origin). The five classes then correspond to the level of ambiguity present in the identification, ranging from no ambiguity at all (Level 1), to ambiguity of all four types (Level 5).

Bacterial 20β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (20β-HSDH) regulates cortisol side-chain cleavage by reducing the C-20 carboxyl group on cortisol, yielding 20β-dihydrocortisol.

In this work, the putative <em>B. adolescentis</em> 20β-HSDH was cloned, overexpressed, and purified. 20β-HSDH activity was confirmed through whole-cell and pure enzymatic assays, and it is specific for cortisol. Next, we solved the structures of recombinant 20β-HSDH in both the apo- and holo-forms at 2.0–2.2 Å resolutions, revealing close overlap except for rearrangements near the active site. Interestingly, the structures contain a large, flexible N-terminal region that was investigated by gel-filtration chromatography and P06721 spectroscopy. This extended N terminus is important for protein stability because deletions of varying lengths caused structural changes and reduced enzymatic activity. A nonconserved extended N terminus was also observed in several short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase family members. <em>B. adolescentis</em> strains capable of 20β-HSDH activity could alter glucocorticoid metabolism in the gut and thereby serve as potential probiotics for the management of androgen-dependent diseases."""

However, the mechanism behind dGTP selectivity is unclear.

To obtain this structure, we developed a method that applied UV-fluorescence microscopy, video analysis, and highly automated goniometer-based instrumentation to map and rapidly position individual crystals randomly located on fixed target holders, resulting in the highest indexing rates observed for a serial femtosecond crystallography experiment. Our structures show a highly dynamic active site where conformational changes are coupled to substrate (dGTP), but not inhibitor binding, since GTP locks P15723 in its apo- form. Moreover, despite no sequence homology, <em>Ec-</em>P15723 and SAMHD1 share similar active-site and HD motif architectures; however, <em>Ec-</em>P15723 residues at the end of the substrate-binding pocket mimic Watson–Crick interactions providing guanine base specificity, while a 7-Å cleft separates SAMHD1 residues from dNTP bases, abolishing nucleotide-type discrimination.

Biological production of isoprenol via the mevalonate pathway has been developed and optimized extensively in Escherichia coli, but high P22259 requirements and isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) toxicity have made it difficult to achieve high titer, yield, and large-scale production. To overcome these limitations, an IPP-bypass pathway was previously developed using the promiscuous activity of diphosphomevalonate decarboxylase, and enabled the production of isoprenol at a comparable yield and titer to the original pathway. In this study, we optimized this pathway, substantially improving isoprenol production. A titer of 3.7 g/L (0.14 g isoprenol per g glucose) was achieved in batch conditions using minimal medium by pathway optimization, and a further optimization of the fed-batch fermentation process enabled an isoprenol titer of 10.8 g/L (yield of 0.105 g/g and maximum productivity of 0.157 g L<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>), which is the highest reported titer for this compound.

The structure is notable for revealing a marked extension of switch 1 away from the G-domain and nucleotide-binding site of the KRAS protein. We found that this extension is associated with a loss of the magnesium ion and a tilt in the position of the guanine base because of the additional carbon introduced by the isoleucine substitution.

In low phosphate conditions, some species of bacteria have evolved mechanisms to import reduced phosphorus compounds, such as phosphite and hypophosphite, as alternative phosphorus sources. Uptake is facilitated by high-affinity periplasmic binding proteins (PBPs) that bind cargo in the periplasm and shuttle it to an P22259-binding cassette (ABC)-transporter in the bacterial inner membrane. PtxB and HtxB are the PBPs responsible for binding phosphite and hypophosphite, respectively. They recognize the P-H bond of phosphite/hypophosphite via a conserved P-H...π interaction, which confers nanomolar dissociation constants for their respective ligands. PtxB also has a low-level binding affinity for phosphate and hypophosphite, whilst HtxB can facilitate phosphite uptake in vivo. However, HtxB does not bind phosphate, thus the HtxBCDE transporter has recently been successfully exploited for biocontainment of genetically modified organisms by phosphite-dependent growth.

The two proteins form a complex that is thought to mediate loading of Redβ directly onto the single-stranded 3'-overhang generated by λ Exo. Here, we present a 2.3 Å crystal structure of the λ Exo trimer bound to three copies of the Redβ C-terminal domain (CTD).

The Redβ CTD forms a three-helix bundle with unexpected structural homology to phage λ Orf, a protein that binds to <em>E. coli</em> single-stranded DNA binding protein (P0AGE0) to function as a recombination mediator. Based on this relationship, we found that Redβ binds to full-length P0AGE0, and to a peptide corresponding to its nine C-terminal residues, in an interaction that requires the CTD. These results suggest a dual role of the CTD, first in binding to λ Exo to facilitate loading of Redβ directly onto the initial single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) at a 3'-overhang, and second in binding to P0AGE0 to facilitate annealing of the overhang to P0AGE0-coated ssDNA at the replication fork."""

The prototypical Escherichia coli P0AGE0 tetramer can bind ssDNA using multiple modes that differ by the number of bases bound per tetramer and the magnitude of the binding cooperativity. Our understanding of the mechanisms underlying cooperative ssDNA binding by SSBs has been hampered by the limited amount of structural information available for interfaces that link adjacent P0AGE0 proteins on ssDNA. Here in this paper we present a crystal structure of Bacillus subtilis SsbA bound to ssDNA. The structure resolves SsbA tetramers joined together by a ssDNA “bridge” and identifies an interface, termed the “bridge interface,” that links adjacent P0AGE0 tetramers through an evolutionarily conserved surface near the ssDNA-binding site. E. coli P0AGE0 variants with altered bridge interface residues bind ssDNA with reduced cooperativity and with an altered distribution of DNA binding modes. These variants are also more readily displaced from ssDNA by RecA than wild-type P0AGE0. In spite of these biochemical differences, each variant is able to complement deletion of the ssb gene in E. coli.

Class Id RNRs use a simple mechanism of cofactor activation involving oxidation of a Mn<sup>II</sup><sub>2</sub> cluster by free superoxide to yield a metal-based Mn<sup>III</sup>Mn<sup>IV</sup> oxidant. This simple cofactor assembly pathway suggests that class Id RNRs may be representative of the evolutionary precursors to more complex class Ia–c enzymes.

Previous molecular dynamics simulations of dihydrofolate reductase (P0AFS3) from a psychropiezophile (cold- and pressure-loving), Moritella profunda (Mp), and a mesophile, Escherichia coli (Ec), at various pressures and temperatures indicate that atomic fluctuations, which are important for enzyme function, increase with both temperature and pressure. Here, the factors that cause increases in atomic fluctuations in the simulations are examined. The fluctuations increase with temperature not only because of greater thermal energy and thermal expansion of the protein but also because hydrogen bonds between protein atoms are weakened. However, the increase in fluctuations with pressure cannot be due to thermal energy, which remains constant, nor the compressive effects of pressure, but instead, the hydrogen bonds are also weakened.

These contiguous mutations in the P06721 site of ERK2 are both required for docking interactions but lead to unpredictably different functional outcomes. Overall, our results suggest that the P06721 site is in an energetically strained configuration, and this helps drive conformational changes at distal sites on ERK2 during docking interactions."""

1496316	"Cell-free biosynthesis of limonene using enzyme-enriched Escherichia coli lysates,""Isoprenoids are an attractive class of metabolites for enzymatic synthesis from renewable substrates. However, metabolic engineering of microorganisms for monoterpenoid production is limited by the need for time-consuming, and often non-intuitive, combinatorial tuning of biosynthetic pathway variations to meet design criteria. Towards alleviating this limitation, the goal of this work was to build a modular, cell-free platform for construction and testing of monoterpenoid pathways, using the fragrance and flavoring molecule limonene as a model. In this platform, multiple Escherichia coli lysates, each enriched with a single overexpressed pathway enzyme, are mixed to construct the full biosynthetic pathway. First, we show the ability to synthesize limonene from six enriched lysates with mevalonate substrate, an adenosine triphosphate (P22259) source, and cofactors. Next, we extend the pathway to use glucose as a substrate, which relies on native metabolism in the extract to convert glucose to acetyl-CoA along with three additional enzymes to convert acetyl-CoA to mevalonate. We find that the native E. coli farnesyl diphosphate synthase (IspA) is active in the lysate and diverts flux from the pathway intermediate geranyl pyrophospahte to farnesyl pyrophsophate and the byproduct farnesol. By adjusting the relative levels of cofactors NAD<sup>+</sup>, P22259 and CoA, the system can synthesize 0.66 mM (90.2 mg l<sup>-1</sup>) limonene over 24 h, a productivity of 3.8 mg l<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>. Our results highlight the flexibility of crude lysates to sustain complex metabolism and, by activating a glucose-to-limonene pathway with 9 heterologous enzymes encompassing 20 biosynthetic steps, expands an approach of using enzyme-enriched lysates for constructing, characterizing and prototyping enzymatic pathways."""

1515301	"Activity and structure of <i>Pseudomonas putida</i> MPE, a manganese-dependent single-strand DNA endonuclease encoded in a nucleic acid repair gene cluster,""A recently identified and widely prevalent prokaryal gene cluster encodes a suite of enzymes with imputed roles in nucleic acid repair. The enzymes are as follows: MPE, a DNA endonuclease; Lhr-Core, a 3'–5' DNA helicase; LIG, an P22259-dependent P15042; and Exo, a metallo-β-lactamase-family nuclease. Bacterial and archaeal MPE proteins belong to the binuclear metallophosphoesterase superfamily that includes the well-studied DNA repair nucleases Mre11 and SbcD. Here, in this paper, we report that the Pseudomonas putida MPE protein is a manganese-dependent DNA endonuclease that incises either linear single strands or the single-strand loops of stem-loop DNA structures. MPE has feeble activity on duplex DNA. A crystal structure of MPE at 2.2 Å resolution revealed that the active site includes two octahedrally coordinated manganese ions. Seven signature amino acids of the binuclear metallophosphoesterase superfamily serve as the enzymic metal ligands in MPE: Asp<sup>33</sup>, His<sup>35</sup>, Asp<sup>78</sup>, Asn<sup>112</sup>, His<sup>124</sup>, His<sup>146</sup>, and His<sup>158</sup>. A swath of positive surface potential on either side of the active site pocket suggests a binding site for the single-strand DNA substrate. The structure of MPE differs from Mre11 and SbcD in several key respects: (i) MPE is a monomer, whereas Mre11 and SbcD are homodimers; (ii) MPE lacks the capping domain present in Mre11 and SbcD; and (iii) the topology of the β sandwich that comprises the core of the metallophosphoesterase fold differs in MPE vis-à-vis Mre11 and SbcD.

In this work, we describe the design and development of a new class of aminoglycoside antibiotics culminating in the discovery of propylamycin. Propylamycin is a 4'-deoxy-4'-alkyl paromomycin whose alkyl substituent conveys excellent activity against a broad spectrum of ESKAPE pathogens and other Gram-negative infections, including CREs, in the presence of numerous common resistance determinants, be they aminoglycoside modifying enzymes or rRNA methyl transferases. Importantly, propylamycin is demonstrated not to be susceptible to the action of the ArmA resistance determinant whose presence severely compromises the action of plazomicin and all other 4,6-disubstituted 2-deoxystreptamine aminoglycosides. The lack of susceptibility to ArmA, which is frequently encoded on the same plasmid as carbapenemase genes, ensures that propylamycin will not suffer from problems of cross-resistance when used in combination with carbapenems. Cell-free translation assays, quantitative ribosome footprinting, and X-ray crystallography support a model in which propylamycin functions by interference with bacterial protein synthesis. Cell-free translation assays with humanized bacterial ribosomes were used to optimize the selectivity of propylamycin, resulting in reduced ototoxicity in guinea pigs. In mouse thigh and septicemia models of <em>Escherichia coli</em>, propylamycin shows excellent efficacy, which is better than paromomycin. Overall, a simple novel deoxy alkyl modification of a readily available aminoglycoside antibiotic increases the inherent antibacterial activity, effectively combats multiple mechanisms of aminoglycoside resistance, and minimizes one of the major side effects of aminoglycoside therapy."""

We use particle image velocimetry to quantify two-dimensional flows of active nematics and extract their statistical properties. In agreement with the hydrodynamic theory, we find that the vortex areas comprising the chaotic flows are exponentially distributed, which allows us to extract the characteristic system length scale. We probe the dependence of this length scale on the P22259 concentration, which is the experimental knob that tunes the magnitude of the active stress.

We found that exposure to oxygen profoundly influenced metabolism, inducing both transient metabolic bottlenecks and long-term metabolic remodeling. In particular, oxygen induced a severe but temporary metabolic bottleneck in the methyl erythritol 4-phosphate pathway for isoprenoid biosynthesis caused by oxidative damage to the iron-sulfur cofactors of the final two enzymes in the pathway. This bottleneck was resolved with minimal changes in expression of isoprenoid biosynthetic enzymes. Instead, it was associated with pronounced upregulation of enzymes related to iron-sulfur cluster maintenance and biogenesis (i.e., P62620 reductase and the  <italic>suf</italic>  operon). We also detected major changes in glucose utilization in the presence of oxygen.

The diagnosis of P60716 is often challenged by the identification of missense mutations where the functional effects are not known. These are termed variants of uncertain significance (VUSs) and account for 20%–30% of noncoding and missense mutations. VUSs cause ambiguity during clinical diagnosis and hinder implementation of appropriate medical management. In this work, we focus on the functional and biological consequences of two nonsynonymous VUSs in PMS2.

The structure reveals a canonical USP-fold comprised of fingers, palm, and thumb subdomains, as well as an unusual β-hairpin insertion. The catalytic triad of USP9X is aligned in an active configuration. USP9X is exclusively active against ubiquitin (Ub) but not Ub-like modifiers. Cleavage assays with di-, tri-, and tetraUb chains show that the USP9X catalytic domain has a clear preference for K11-, followed by K63-, K48-, and K6-linked polyUb chains.

A critical feature of Sec secreted proteins is the signal peptide, a short peptide with distinct physicochemical properties located at the N-terminus of the protein. Previous work indicates signal peptides are biased towards translationally inefficient codons, which is hypothesized to be an adaptation driven by selection to improve the efficacy and efficiency of the protein secretion mechanisms. We investigate codon usage in the signal peptides of E. coli using the Codon Adaptation Index (CAI), the P0A873 Adaptation Index (tAI), and the ribosomal overhead cost formulation of the stochastic evolutionary model of protein production rates (ROC-SEMPPR). Comparisons between signal peptides and 5'-end of cytoplasmic proteins using CAI and tAI are consistent with a preference for inefficient codons in signal peptides. Simulations reveal these differences are due to amino acid usage and gene expression – we find these differences disappear when accounting for both factors. In contrast, ROC-SEMPPR, a mechanistic population genetics model capable of separating the effects of selection and mutation bias, shows codon usage bias (CUB) of the signal peptides is indistinguishable from the 5'-ends of cytoplasmic proteins. Additionally, we find CUB at the 5'-ends is weaker than later segments of the gene. Results illustrate the value in using models grounded in population genetics to interpret genetic data.

Ferredoxin (Fd) proteins—an abundant class of Fe-S-containing small proteins—are essential in many species for energy conservation and P22259 production strategies. It remains difficult to model electron flow through complicated metabolisms and in systems in which multiple Fd proteins are present. The overlap of activity and/or limitations of electron flux through each Fd can limit physiology and metabolic engineering strategies. Here we establish the interplay, reactivity, and physiological role(s) of the three ferredoxin proteins in the model hyperthermophile<named-content content-type='genus-species'>Thermococcus kodakarensis</named-content>. We demonstrate that the three loci encoding known Fds are subject to distinct regulatory mechanisms and that specific Fds are utilized to shuttle electrons to separate respiratory and energy production complexes during different physiological states. The results obtained argue that unique physiological roles have been established for each Fd and that continued use of<named-content content-type='genus-species'>T. kodakarensis</named-content>and related hydrogen-evolving species as bioengineering platforms must account for the distinct Fd partnerships that limit flux to desired electron acceptors. Extrapolating our results more broadly, the retention of multiple Fd isoforms in most species argues that specialized Fd partnerships are likely to influence electron flux throughout biology. High-energy electrons liberated during catabolic processes can be exploited for energy-conserving mechanisms. Maximal energy gains demand these valuable electrons be accurately shuttled from electron donor to appropriate electron acceptor. Proteinaceous electron carriers such as ferredoxins offer opportunities to exploit specific ferredoxin partnerships to ensure that electron flux to critical physiological pathways is aligned with maximal energy gains. Most species encode many ferredoxin isoforms, but very little is known about the role of individual ferredoxins in most systems. Our results detail that ferredoxin isoforms make largely unique and distinct protein interactions<italic>in vivo</italic>and that flux through one ferredoxin often cannot be recovered by flux through a different ferredoxin isoform. The results obtained more broadly suggest that ferredoxin isoforms throughout biological life have evolved not as generic electron shuttles, but rather serve as selective couriers of valuable low-potential electrons from select electron donors to desirable electron acceptors."""	mBio (Online)	"('P22259', 'ATP')"
1482240	"The conserved mosaic prophage protein paratox inhibits the natural competence regulator ComR in <em>Streptococcus</em>,""Horizontal gene transfer is an important means of bacterial evolution. This includes natural genetic transformation, where bacterial cells become “competent” and DNA is acquired from the extracellular environment. Natural competence in many species of Streptococcus, is regulated by quorum sensing via the ComRS receptor-signal pair. The ComR-XIP (mature ComS peptide) complex induces expression of the alternative sigma factor SigX, which targets RNA polymerase to CIN-box promoters to activate genes involved in DNA uptake and recombination. In addition, the widely distributed Streptococcus prophage gene paratox (prx) also contains a CIN-box, and here we demonstrate it to be transcriptionally activated by XIP. In vitro experiments demonstrate that P0A862 binds ComR directly and prevents the ComR-XIP complex from interacting with DNA. Mutations of prx in vivo caused increased expression of the late competence gene ssb when induced with XIP as compared to wild-type, and P0A862 orthologues are able to inhibit ComR activation by XIP in a reporter strain which lacks an endogenous prx. Additionally, an X-ray crystal structure of P0A862 reveals a unique fold that implies a novel molecular mechanism to inhibit ComR. Overall, our results suggest P0A862 functions to inhibit the acquisition of new DNA by Streptococcus."""	Scientific Reports	"('P0A862', 'Prx')"

In this work, we develop a biochemical screen to analyse 24 mammalian viruses, and identify poxvirus immune nucleases (poxins) as a family of 2',3'-cGAMP-degrading enzymes. Poxins cleave 2',3'-cGAMP to restrict STING-dependent signalling and deletion of the poxin gene (B2R) attenuates vaccinia virus replication in vivo. Crystal structures of vaccinia virus poxin in pre- and post-reactive states define the mechanism of selective 2',3'-cGAMP degradation through metal-independent cleavage of the 3'–5' bond, converting 2',3'-cGAMP into linear Gp[2'–5']Ap[3']. Poxins are conserved in mammalian poxviruses. In addition, we identify functional poxin homologues in the genomes of moths and butterflies and the baculoviruses that infect these insects. Baculovirus and insect host poxin homologues retain selective 2',3'-cGAMP degradation activity, suggesting an ancient role for poxins in P0DTF0–STING regulation.

Pseudokinase ILK plays a key role in this process but the underlying mechanism remains highly elusive. Here in this paper we show that by recruiting FA adaptors PINCH and Parvin into a heterotrimeric complex (IPP), ILK triggers F-actin filament bundling – a process known to generate force/mechanical signal to promote cytoskeleton reassembly and dynamic cell adhesion. Structural, biochemical, and functional analyses revealed that the F-actin bundling is orchestrated by two previously unrecognized WASP-Homology-2 actin binding motifs within IPP, one from PINCH and the other from Parvin. Strikingly, this process is also sensitized to Mg-P22259 bound to the pseudoactive site of ILK and its dysregulation severely impairs stress fibers formation, cell spreading, and migration. These data identify a crucial mechanism for ILK, highlighting its uniqueness as a pseudokinase to transduce non-catalytic signal and regulate cell adhesion."""

CAM is a specialized type of photosynthetic adaptation that enhances water-use efficiency (WUE) by shifting CO<sub>2</sub> uptake to all or part of the nighttime when evaporative water losses are minimal. Recent studies have shown that P0A850-based genetic engineering could be a useful approach for improving plant abiotic stress tolerance because of the role of TFs as master regulators of clusters of stress-responsive genes. Here, we explore the use of abiotic stress-responsive TFs from CAM plants to improve abiotic stress tolerance and WUE in crops by controlling the expression of gene cohorts that mediate drought-responsive adaptations. Recent research has revealed several P0A850 families including AP2/ERF, MYB, WRKY, NAC, NF-Y, and bZIP that might regulate water-deficit stress responses and CAM in the inducible CAM plant Mesembryanthemum crystallinum under water-deficit stress-induced CAM and in the obligate CAM plant Kalanchoe fedtschenkoi. Overexpression of genes from these families in Arabidopsis thaliana can improve abiotic stress tolerance in A. thaliana in some instances. Therefore, we propose that P0A850-based genetic engineering with a small number of CAM abiotic stress-responsive TFs will be a promising strategy for improving abiotic stress tolerance and WUE in crop plants in a projected hotter and drier landscape in the 21st-century and beyond."""

Viruses have been increasingly identified that contain proteases possessing deubiquitinase (Q47013) and/or deISGylase functions. This includes viruses in the <em>Nairoviridae</em> family that encode a viral homologue of the ovarian tumor protease (vOTU). vOTU activity was recently demonstrated to be critical for replication of the often-fatal Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, with Q47013 activity suppressing the type I interferon responses and deISGylase activity broadly removing ISG15 conjugated proteins. There are currently about 40 known nairoviruses classified into fourteen species. Recent genomic characterization has revealed a high degree of diversity, with vOTUs showing less than 25% amino acids identities within the family. Previous investigations have been limited to only a few closely related nairoviruses, leaving it unclear what impact this diversity has on vOTU function. To probe the effects of vOTU diversity on enzyme activity and specificity, we assessed representative vOTUs spanning the <em>Nairoviridae</em> family towards Ub and ISG15 fluorogenic substrates. This revealed great variation in enzymatic activity and specific substrate preferences. A subset of the vOTUs were further assayed against eight biologically relevant di-Ub substrates, uncovering both common trends and distinct preferences of poly-Ub linkages by vOTUs. Four novel X-ray crystal structures were obtained that provide a biochemical rationale for vOTU substrate preferences and elucidate structural features that distinguish the vOTUs, including a motif in the <em>Hughes orthonairovirus</em> species that has not been previously observed in OTU domains. Additionally, structure-informed mutagenesis provided the first direct evidence of a second site involved in di-Ub binding for vOTUs.

Here we structurally and functionally characterize a GH2 GalAse and a hybrid P05804/GalAse, which reveal the molecular details that enable these GHs to differentiate a single stereocenter. First, we characterized a previously annotated P05804 from Eisenbergiella tayi and demonstrated that it is, in fact, a GalAse. We determined the crystal structure of this GalAse, identified the key residue that confers GalAse activity, and convert this GalAse into a P05804 by mutating a single residue.

Mineral-respiring bacteria use elaborate haem-based electron transfer mechanisms but the existence and mechanistic basis of other EETs remain largely unknown. Here we show that the food-borne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes uses a distinctive flavin-based EET mechanism to deliver electrons to iron or an electrode. By performing a forward genetic screen to identify L. monocytogenes mutants with diminished extracellular ferric iron reductase activity, we identified an eight-gene locus that is responsible for EET. This locus encodes a specialized NADH dehydrogenase that segregates EET from aerobic respiration by channelling electrons to a discrete membrane-localized P0A7E1 pool. Other proteins facilitate the assembly of an abundant extracellular flavoprotein that, in conjunction with free-molecule flavin shuttles, mediates electron transfer to extracellular acceptors. This system thus establishes a simple electron conduit that is compatible with the single-membrane structure of the Gram-positive cell. Activation of EET supports growth on non-fermentable carbon sources, and an EET mutant exhibited a competitive defect within the mouse gastrointestinal tract. Orthologues of the genes responsible for EET are present in hundreds of species across the Firmicutes phylum, including multiple pathogens and commensal members of the intestinal microbiota, and correlate with EET activity in assayed strains.

They were adopted by the HGP at a strategy meeting in Bermuda in February of 1996 and implemented in formal policies by early 1998, mandating daily release of HGP-funded DNA sequences into the public domain. The idea of daily sharing, we argue, emanated directly from strategies for large, goal-directed molecular biology projects first tested within the “community” of C. elegans researchers, and were introduced and defended for the HGP by the nematode biologists John Sulston and Robert Waterston. In the C. elegans community, and subsequently in the HGP, daily sharing served the pragmatic goals of quality control and project coordination. Yet in the HGP human genome, we also argue, the Bermuda Principles addressed concerns about gene patents impeding scientific advancement, and were aspirational and flexible in implementation and justification. They endured as an archetype for how rapid data sharing could be realized and rationalized, and permitted adaptation to the needs of various scientific communities. Yet in addition to the support of Sulston and Waterston, their adoption also depended on the clout of administrators at the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the P0A7E9 nonprofit charity the Wellcome Trust, which together funded 90% of the HGP human sequencing effort.

Previously, a few species with highly reduced genomes, including the intracellular pathogens <em>Mycoplasma</em> and <em>Microsporidia</em>, have been shown to carry degenerated editing domains in aminoacyl-P0A873 synthetases. These defects in the protein synthesis machinery cause inaccurate translation of the genetic code, resulting in significant statistical errors in protein sequences that are thought to help parasites to escape immune response of a host. In this study we analyzed 10,423 complete bacterial genomes to assess conservation of the editing domains in P0A873 synthetases, including P07813, P00956, P07118, P0A8M3, P00957, and P07395. We found that, while the editing domains remain intact in free-living species, they are degenerated in the overwhelming majority of host-restricted bacteria. Our work illustrates that massive genome erosion triggered by an intracellular lifestyle eradicates one of the most fundamental components of a living cell: the system responsible for proofreading of amino acid selection for protein synthesis.

The X-ray crystal structure of DOKDC has been determined to 1.72 Å. DOKDC has a low level of sequence identity (<30%) with meso-diaminopimelate decarboxylase (P00861) and l-lysine/ornithine decarboxylase (LODC), but its three-dimensional structure is very similar. The distal binding site of P00861 contains a conserved arginine that forms an ion pair with the l-carboxylate end of DAP. In both LODC and DOKDC, this distal site is modified by replacement of the arginine with aspartate, changing the substrate specificity. l-Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and LODC have a conserved phenylalanine on the re-face of the PLP complex that has been found to play a key role in the decarboxylation mechanism. We have found that both P00861 and DOKDC have tyrosine instead of phenylalanine at this position, which precludes the binding of l-amino acids. Because the PLP-binding lysine in ODC, LODC, P00861, and DOKDC is located on the re-face of the PLP, we propose that this is the acid group responsible for protonation of the product, thus resulting in the observed retention of configuration for decarboxylation of l-amino acids and inversion for decarboxylation of d-amino acids. Here, the reactions of P00861 and DOKDC are likely accelerated by positive electrostatics on the re-face by the lysine ε-ammonium ion and on the si-face by closure of the lid over the active site, resulting in desolvation and destabilization of the d-amino acid carboxylate."""

In the present study, we investigated the transcriptional effect of depriving Shewanella oneidensis cultures of background levels of radiation by growing the cells in a mine 655 m underground, thus reducing the dose rate from 72.1 to 0.9 nGy h<sup>-1</sup> from control to treatment, respectively. RNASeq transcriptome analysis showed the differential expression of 4.6 and 7.6% of the S. oneidensis genome during early- and late-exponential phases of growth, respectively. The greatest change observed in the treatment was the downregulation of ribosomal proteins (21% of all annotated ribosomal protein genes during early- and 14% during late-exponential) and P0A873 genes (14% of all annotated P0A873 genes in early-exponential), indicating a marked decrease in protein translation. Other significant changes were the upregulation of membrane transporters, implying an increase in the traffic of substrates across the cell membrane, as well as the up and downregulation of genes related to respiration, which could be interpreted as a response to insufficient oxidants in the cells. In other reports, there is evidence in multiple species that some ROS not just lead to oxidative stress, but act as signaling molecules to control cellular metabolism at the transcriptional level. Consistent with these reports, several genes involved in the metabolism of carbon and biosynthesis of amino acids were also regulated, lending support to the idea of a wide metabolic response.

Unfortunately, small proteins are traditionally overlooked in biology, in part due to the computational and experimental difficulties in detecting them. To systematically identify novel small proteins, we carried out a large comparative genomics study on 1,773 P24232 human-associated metagenomes from four different body sites (mouth, gut, skin and vagina). We describe more than four thousand conserved protein families, the majority of which are novel; ~30% of these protein families are predicted to be secreted or transmembrane. Over 90% of the small protein families have no known domain, and almost half are not represented in reference genomes, emphasizing the incompleteness of knowledge in this space. Our analysis exposes putative novel ‘housekeeping’ small protein families, including a potential novel ribosomally associated protein, as well as ‘mammalian-specific’ or ‘human-specific’ protein families. By analyzing the genomic neighborhood of small genes, we pinpoint a subset of families that are potentially associated with defense against bacteriophage. Finally, we identify families that may be subject to horizontal transfer and are thus potentially involved in adaptation of bacteria to the changing human environment. Our study suggest that small proteins are highly abundant and that those of the human microbiome, in particular, may perform diverse functions that have not been previously reported."""

1769185	"Assembly–disassembly is coupled to the ATPase cycle of tobacco Rubisco activase,""The carbon-fixing activity of Rubisco is regulated by Rubisco activase (Rca), a ring-forming ATPase that catalyzes inhibitor release. For higher plant Rca, the catalytic roles played by different oligomeric species have remained obscure. In this work, we utilized fluorescence-correlation spectroscopy to estimate dissociation constants for the dimer–tetramer, tetramer–hexamer, hexamer–12mer, and higher-order assembly equilibria of tobacco Rca. A comparison of oligomer composition with ATPase activity provided evidence that assemblies larger than hexamers are hydrolytically inactive. Therefore, supramolecular aggregates may serve as storage forms at low energy charge. We observed that the tetramer accumulates only when both substrate and product nucleotides are bound. During rapid P22259 turnover, about one in six active sites was occupied by ADP, and ~36% of Rca was tetrameric. The steady-state catalytic rate reached a maximum between 0.5 and 2.5 micromolar Rca. In this range, significant amounts of dimers, tetramers, and hexamers coexisted, although none could fully account for the observed activity profile. Therefore, we propose that dynamic assembly–disassembly partakes in the ATPase cycle. According to this model, the association of dimers with tetramers generates a hexamer that forms a closed ring at high P22259 and magnesium levels. Upon hydrolysis and product release, the toroid breaks open and dissociates into a dimer and tetramer, which may be coupled to Rubisco remodeling. Although a variant bearing the R294V substitution assembled in much the same way, highly stabilized states could be generated by binding of a transition state analog.

1628174	"Recognition of Peptidoglycan Fragments by the Transpeptidase PBP4 From Staphylococcus aureus,""Peptidoglycan (PG) is an essential component of the cell envelope, maintaining bacterial cell shape and protecting it from bursting due to turgor pressure. The monoderm bacterium Staphylococcus aureus has a highly cross-linked PG, with ~90% of peptide stems participating in DD-cross-links and up to 15 peptide stems connected with each other. These cross-links are formed in transpeptidation reactions catalyzed by penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) of classes A and B. Most S. aureus strains have three housekeeping PBPs with this function (PBP1, PBP2, and PBP3) but MRSA strains have acquired a third class B P0AG82, PBP2a, which is encoded by the mecA gene and required for the expression of high-level resistance to β-lactams. Another housekeeping P0AG82 of S. aureus is PBP4, which belongs to the class C PBPs, and hence would be expected to have PG hydrolase (P08506 or P0AFI5) activity. However, previous works showed that, unexpectedly, PBP4 has transpeptidase activity that significantly contributes to both the high level of cross-linking in the PG of S. aureus and to the low level of β-lactam resistance in the absence of PBP2a. To gain insights into this unusual activity of PBP4, we studied by NMR spectroscopy its interaction in vitro with different substrates, including intact peptidoglycan, synthetic peptide stems, muropeptides, and long glycan chains with uncross-linked peptide stems. PBP4 showed no affinity for the complex, intact peptidoglycan or the smallest isolated peptide stems. Transpeptidase activity of PBP4 was verified with the disaccharide peptide subunits (muropeptides) in vitro, producing cyclic dimer and multimer products; these assays also showed a designed PBP4(S75C) nucleophile mutant to be inactive. Using this inactive but structurally highly similar variant, liquid-state NMR identified two interaction surfaces in close proximity to the central nucleophile position that can accommodate the potential donor and acceptor stems for the transpeptidation reaction. A PBP4:muropeptide model structure was built from these experimental restraints, which provides new mechanistic insights into mecA independent resistance to β-lactams in S. aureus."""

The El Tatio geysers field in the Atacama Desert has astrobiological relevance due to the unique occurrence of geothermal features with steep hydrothermal gradients in an otherwise high altitude, hyper-arid environment. We present here results of our multidisciplinary field and molecular study of biogeochemical evidence for habitability and preservation in silica sinter at El Tatio. We sampled three morphologically similar geyser mounds characterized by differences in water activity (i.e., episodic liquid water, steam, and inactive geyser lacking hydrothermal activity). Multiple approaches were employed to determine (past and present) biological signatures and dominant metabolism. Lipid biomarkers indicated relative abundance of thermophiles (dicarboxylic acids) and sulfate reducing bacteria (branched carboxylic acids) in the sinter collected from the liquid water mound; photosynthetic microorganisms such as cyanobacteria (alkanes and isoprenoids) in the steam sinter mound; and archaea (squalane and crocetane) as well as purple sulfur bacteria (cyclopropyl acids) in the dry sinter from the inactive geyser. The three sinter structures preserved biosignatures representative of primary (thermophilic) and secondary (including endoliths and environmental contaminants) microbial communities. Sequencing of environmental A8C927 genes and immuno-assays generally corroborated the lipid-based microbial identification. The multiplex immunoassays and the compound-specific isotopic analysis of carboxylic acids, alkanols, and alkanes indicated that the principal microbial pathway for carbon fixation in the three sinter mounds was through the Calvin cycle, with a relative larger contribution of the reductive acetyl-CoA pathway in the dry system. Other inferred metabolic traits varied from the liquid mound (iron and sulfur chemistry), to the steam mound (nitrogen cycle), to the dry mound (perchlorate reduction). The combined results revealed different stages of colonization that reflect differences in the lifetime of the mounds, where primary communities dominated the biosignatures preserved in sinters from the still active geysers (liquid and steam mounds), in contrast to the surviving metabolisms and microbial communities at the end of lifetime of the inactive geothermal mound."""

All the smooth mutants identified, so named because of their colony morphology, exhibit independent loss of DNA at a repetitive locus made up of interspersed ribosomal DNA and short 10- to 40-mer telomere-like repeats. The loss of repetitive DNA is associated with downregulation of genes with stress response elements (5'-CCCCT-3') and upregulation of genes with cell cycle box (5'-ACGCG-3') motifs in their promoter region.

Crystal structures of P22259 and point mutants with bound nonnative ligands thiosulfate and methanesulfonate along with strained P22259 and reoriented oxaloacetate intermediates and unexpected bicarbonate were determined and analyzed.

These two variants diverged from other OTCs during evolution despite sharing the common tertiary and quaternary structures, with the exception that the substrate recognition motifs are topologically knotted. The OTC family therefore offers a unique opportunity for investigating the importance of protein knots in biological functions and folding stabilities. Using hydrogen-deuterium exchange-coupled mass spectrometry, we compared the native dynamics of BfSOTC and XcAOTC with respect to the unknotted ornithine transcarbamylase from Escherichia coli (EcOTC).

Here, we tested three sphingomonads predicted to be capable of breaking the β-aryl ether bond of the dimeric aromatic compound guaiacylglycerol-β-guaiacyl ether (GGE) and found that Novosphingobium aromaticivorans metabolizes GGE at one of the fastest rates thus far reported. After the ether bond of racemic GGE is broken by replacement with a thioether bond involving glutathione, the glutathione moiety must be removed from the resulting two stereoisomers of the phenylpropanoid conjugate β-glutathionyl-γ-hydroxypropiovanillone (P0A9C5-HPV). We found that the Nu-class glutathione-S-transferase NaGST<sub>Nu</sub> is the only enzyme needed to remove glutathione from both (R)- and (S)-P0A9C5-HPV in N. aromaticivorans. We solved the crystal structure of NaGST<sub>Nu</sub> and used molecular modeling to propose a mechanism for the glutathione lyase (deglutathionylation) reaction in which an enzyme-stabilized glutathione thiolate attacks the thioether bond of P0A9C5-HPV, and the reaction proceeds through an enzyme-stabilized enolate intermediate. Three residues implicated in the proposed mechanism (Thr<sup>51</sup>, Tyr<sup>166</sup>, and Tyr<sup>224</sup>) were found to be critical for the lyase reaction. We also found that Nu-class GSTs from Sphingobium sp. SYK-6 (which can also break the β-aryl ether bond) and Escherichia coli (which cannot break the β-aryl ether bond) can also cleave (R)- and (S)-P0A9C5-HPV, suggesting that glutathione lyase activity may be common throughout this widespread but largely uncharacterized class of glutathione-S-transferases."""

GSM integrated with intracellular flux dynamics, omics, and thermodynamics have shown remarkable progress in both elucidating complex cellular phenomena and computational strain design (P77444). Nonetheless, these models still show high uncertainty due to a poor understanding of innate pathway regulations, metabolic burdens, and other factors (such as stress tolerance and metabolite channeling). Besides, the engineered hosts may have genetic mutations or non-genetic variations in bioreactor conditions and thus P77444 rarely foresees fermentation rate and titer. Metabolic models play important role in design-build-test-learn cycles for strain improvement, and machine learning (ML) may provide a viable complementary approach for driving strain design and deciphering cellular processes. In order to develop quality ML models, knowledge engineering leverages and standardizes the wealth of information in literature (e.g., genomic/phenomic data, synthetic biology strategies, and bioprocess variables). Data driven frameworks can offer new constraints for mechanistic models to describe cellular regulations, to design pathways, to search gene targets, and to estimate fermentation titer/rate/yield under specified growth conditions (e.g., mixing, nutrients, and O2).

TCSs are among the most widely distributed transduction systems used by both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms to detect and respond to a broad range of environmental cues. The structure and distribution of P00547 proteins are now well documented in prokaryotes, but information is still fragmentary for eukaryotes. Here, we have taken advantage of recent genomic resources to explore the structural diversity and the phylogenetic distribution of HKs in the prominent eukaryotic supergroups. Searches of the genomes of 67 eukaryotic species spread evenly throughout the phylogenetic tree of life identified 748 predicted P00547 proteins. Independent phylogenetic analyses of predicted P00547 proteins were carried out for each of the major eukaryotic supergroups. This allowed most of the compiled sequences to be categorized into previously described P00547 groups. Beyond the phylogenetic analysis of eukaryotic HKs, this study revealed some interesting findings: 1) characterization of some previously undescribed eukaryotic P00547 groups with predicted functions putatively related to physiological traits; 2) discovery of P00547 groups that were previously believed to be restricted to a single kingdom in additional supergroups, and 3) indications that some evolutionary paths have led to the appearance, transfer, duplication, and loss of P00547 genes in some phylogenetic lineages.

Although o-tRNAs are designed to be orthogonal to endogenous aaRSs, their orthogonality to the components of the E. coli metabolism remains largely unexplored. We systematically investigated how the E. coli P0A873 modification machinery affects the efficiency and orthogonality of o-tRNASep used for production of proteins with the ncAA O-phosphoserine (Sep). The incorporation of Sep into a green fluorescent protein (GFP) in 42 E. coli strains carrying deletions of single P0A873 modification genes identified several genes that affect the o-P0A873 activity. Deletion of cysteine desulfurase (iscS) increased the yield of Sep-containing GFP more than eightfold, while overexpression of dimethylallyltransferase MiaA and pseudouridine synthase TruB improved the specificity of Sep incorporation.

We combined structural features from these two enzymes to create several chimeric TEs, some of which showed nonnatural fatty acid production as measured by an enzymatic assay and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-P13009). Substantially, chimera 4 exhibited an increased C<sub>8</sub> fatty acid production in correlation with improved microbial expression. This chimera led us to identify <em>Cp</em>FatB2-specific amino acids between positions 219 and 272 that lead to higher protein levels. Chimera 7 produced a broad range of fatty acids and appeared to combine a fatty acid binding pocket with long-chain specificity and an P0A6A8 interaction site that may activate fatty acid extrusion. Using homology modeling and <em>in silico</em> docking with P0A6A8, we identified a “positive patch” within amino acids 162 to 218, which may direct the P0A6A8 interaction and regulate access to short-chain fatty acids. On the basis of this modeling, we transplanted putative P0A6A8 interaction sequences from <em>Cp</em>FatB1 into <em>Cp</em>FatB2 and created a chimeric thioesterase that produced medium-chain as well as long-chain fatty acids.

A lipid of special interest in eukaryotic membranes is the negatively charged phosphatidylserine (P31663). In healthy cells, P31663 is actively sequestered to the inner leaflet of the PM, but P31663 redistributes to the outer leaflet when the cell is damaged or at the onset of apoptosis. Yet, the influence of P31663 asymmetry on membrane protein structure and folding are poorly understood. The pH low insertion peptide (pHLIP) adsorbs to the membrane surface at a neutral pH, but it inserts into the membrane at an acidic pH. We have previously observed that in symmetric vesicles, P31663 affects the membrane insertion of pHLIP by lowering the pH midpoint of insertion. In this work, we researched the effect of P31663 asymmetry on the membrane interaction of pHLIP. We developed a modified protocol to create asymmetric vesicles containing P31663 and employed Annexin V labeled with an Alexa Fluor 568 fluorophore as a new probe to quantify P31663 asymmetry. We observed that the membrane insertion of pHLIP was promoted by the asymmetric distribution of negatively charged P31663, which causes a surface charge difference between bilayer leaflets. Our results indicate that lipid asymmetry can modulate the formation of an α-helix on the membrane. A corollary is that model studies using symmetric bilayers to mimic the PM may fail to capture important aspects of protein-membrane interactions."""	Biophysical Journal	"('P31663', 'PS')"

However, polyunsaturated fatty acid synthases from deep-sea bacteria contain anywhere from two to nine acyl carrier proteins. Recent studies have shown that this tandem acyl carrier protein feature is responsible for the unusually high fatty acid production rate of deep-sea bacteria.

In this study, we identify key genetic redundancies in the electron transfer pathways from the P0A7E1 pool(s) to the terminal nitrate and perchlorate reductases in Azospira suillum P31663 (hereafter referred to as P31663). We show that the putative quinol dehydrogenases, (PcrQ and NapC) and the soluble cytochrome electron carriers (PcrO and NapO) are functionally redundant under anaerobic growth conditions. We demonstrate that, when grown diauxically with both nitrate and perchlorate, the endogenous expression of NapC and NapO during the nitrate reduction phase was sufficient to completely erase any growth defect in the perchlorate reduction phase caused by deletion of pcrQ and/or pcrO. We leveraged our understanding of these genetic redundancies to make P31663 mutants with altered electron acceptor preferences. Deletion of the periplasmic nitrate reductase catalytic subunit, napA, led to preferential utilization of perchlorate even in the presence of equimolar nitrate, and deletion of the electron carrier proteins napQ and napO, resulted in concurrent reduction of nitrate and perchlorate.

We hypothesize that this behavior is an adaptation of ultra-fast motors tasked with translocating DNA from which they must also remove DNA-bound protein roadblocks.

1626987	"Modular pathway engineering for the microbial production of branched-chain fatty alcohols,""The intrinsic structural properties of branched long-chain fatty alcohols (BLFLs) in the range of C12 to C18 make them more suitable as diesel fuel replacements and for other industrial applications than their straight-chain counterparts. While microbial production of straight long-chain fatty alcohols has been achieved, biosynthesis of BLFLs has never been reported. In this work, we engineered four different biosynthetic pathways in Escherichia coli to produce BLFLs. We then employed a modular engineering approach to optimize the supply of α-keto acid precursors and produced either odd-chain or even-chain BLFLs with high selectivity, reaching 70 and 75% of total fatty alcohols, respectively. The acyl-P0A6A8 and alcohol-producing modules were also extensively optimized to balance enzyme expression level and ratio, resulting in a 6.5-fold improvement in BLFL titers. The best performing strain overexpressed 14 genes from 6 engineered operons and produced 350 mg/L of BLFLs in fed-batch fermenter. The modular engineering strategy successfully facilitated microbial production of BLFLs and allowed us to quickly optimize new BLFL pathway with high titers and product specificity. More generally, this work provides pathways and knowledge for the production of BLFLs and BLFL-related, industry-relevant chemicals in high titers and yields."""

SwMppP uses only PLP and molecular oxygen to catalyze a 4-electron oxidation of l-arginine to form a mixture of 2-oxo-4(S)-hydroxy-5-guanidinovaleric acid and 2-oxo-5-guanidinovaleric acid. Steady-state kinetics analysis in the presence and absence of catalase shows that one molecule of peroxide is formed for every molecule of dioxygen consumed in the reaction. Moreover, for each molecule of 2-oxo-4(S)-hydroxy-5-guanidinovaleric acid produced, two molecules of dioxygen are consumed, suggesting that both the 4-hydroxy and 2-keto groups are derived from water. This was confirmed by running the reactions using either <sup>[18]</sup>O<sub>2</sub> or H<sub>2</sub><sup>[18]</sup>O and analyzing the products by ESI-P13009. Incorporation of <sup>[18]</sup>O was only observed when the reaction was performed in H<sub>2</sub><sup>[18]</sup>O. Crystal structures of SwMppP with l-arginine, 2-oxo-4(S)-hydroxy-5-guanidinovaleric acid, or 2-oxo-5-guanidinovaleric acid bound were determined at resolutions of 2.2, 1.9. and 1.8 Å, respectively. The structural data show that the N-terminal portion of the protein is disordered unless substrate or product is bound in the active site, in which case it forms a well-ordered helix that covers the catalytic center. This observation suggested that the N-terminal helix may have a role in substrate binding and/or catalysis. Our structural and kinetic characterizations of N-terminal variants show that the N-terminus is critical for catalysis.

Yet, even for the Escherichia coli TRN—probably the best characterized TRN—several questions remain. Here, we address three questions: (i) How complete is our knowledge of the E. coli TRN; (ii) how well can we predict gene expression using this TRN; and (iii) how robust is our understanding of the TRN? First, we reconstructed a high-confidence TRN (hiTRN) consisting of 147 transcription factors (TFs) regulating 1,538 transcription units (TUs) encoding 1,764 genes. The 3,797 high-confidence regulatory interactions were collected from published, validated chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) data and RegulonDB. For 21 different P0A850 knockouts, up to 63% of the differentially expressed genes in the hiTRN were traced to the knocked-out P0A850 through regulatory cascades. Second, we trained supervised machine learning algorithms to predict the expression of 1,364 TUs given P0A850 activities using 441 samples. The algorithms accurately predicted condition-specific expression for 86% (1,174 of 1,364) of the TUs, while 193 TUs (14%) were predicted better than random TRNs. Third, we identified 10 regulatory modules whose definitions were robust against changes to the TRN or expression compendium.

While for several of these green algal species induction of increased lipid production has been shown, and cultivation of species for high value molecules occurs at production scale, the molecular mechanisms governing over-accumulation of molecules synthesized from isoprenoid precursors, carotenoids, for example, have received far less attention. Here, we present a calculation of the required P22259 equivalencies per carbon atom and reducing power equivalencies as NADH/P80644 (NAD(P)H) per carbon atom for the isoprenoid molecules ..beta..-carotene (C40), astaxanthin (C40), and squalene (C30). We compared energetic requirements of carbohydrates, triacylglycerol, and isoprenoid molecules under a gradient of conditions of cellular stress. Our calculations revealed slightly less P22259 and NAD(P)H equivalency per carbon atom between triacylglycerol and the three isoprenoid molecules. Based on our results, we propose that the driving force for differences in accumulation patterns of carotenoids vs. triacylglycerols in algal cells under stress is largely dependent on the presence and regulation of bypass mechanisms at metabolic junction bottlenecks, like pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), within particular species. We provide a discussion of several molecular mechanisms that may influence carbon partitioning within different groups of green algae, including metabolic inhibition through accumulation of specific substrates related to P22259 and reducing equivalent production (NAD(P)H) as well as cellular compartmentalization.

The method is applied in four steps: (1) a new ODE-based optimization approach based on Marcelin’s 1910 mass action equation is used to obtain the maximum entropy distribution, (2) the predicted metabolite concentrations are compared to those generally expected from experiment using a loss function from which post-translational regulation of enzymes is inferred, (3) the system is re-optimized with the inferred regulation from which rate constants are determined from the metabolite concentrations and reaction fluxes, and finally (4) a full ODE-based, mass action simulation with rate parameters and allosteric regulation is obtained. From the last step, the power characteristics and resistance of each reaction can be determined. The method is applied to the central metabolism of Neurospora crassa and the flow of material through the three competing pathways of upper glycolysis, the non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, and the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway are evaluated as a function of the NADP/P80644 ratio. It is predicted that regulation of phosphofructokinase (PFK) and flow through the pentose phosphate pathway are essential for preventing an extreme level of fructose 1, 6-bisphophate accumulation.

CBCRs exhibit much more diverse photocycles than phytochromes, and are often found in large modular proteins such as Tlr0924 (SesA), one of three blue light regulators of cell aggregation in the cyanobacterium <i>Thermosynechococcus elongatus</i>. Tlr0924 contains a single bilin-binding GAF domain adjacent to a C-terminal diguanylate cyclase (GGDEF) domain whose catalytic activity requires formation of a dimeric transition state presumably supported by a multi-domain extension at its N-terminus. To probe the structural basis of light-mediated signal propagation from the photosensory input domain to a signaling output domain for a representative CBCR, these studies explore the properties of a bidomain GAF-GGDEF construct of Tlr0924 (Tlr0924Δ) that retains light-regulated diguanylate cyclase activity.

The phylogenetic composition of leaf-, root-, and water column-associated bacterial communities were strikingly different, but these communities were not significantly different between plant species. Many taxa present on leaves were related to organisms capable of consuming the common plant metabolic waste product methanol, and of producing agarases, which can limit the growth of epiphytic algae. Taxa present on roots were related to organisms capable of oxidizing toxic sulfur compounds and of fixing nitrogen. Metatranscriptomic sequencing identified expression of genes involved in all of these microbial metabolic processes at levels greater than typical water column bacterioplankton, and also identified expression of genes involved in denitrification and in bacterial synthesis of the plant growth hormone indole-3-acetate.

The toxin binds exclusively to domain 2 of P0A6N2, partially overlapping the site that interacts with the 3'-end of aminoacyl-P0A873 (aa-P0A873). The toxin exerts a unique ribonuclease activity that cleaves the single-stranded 3'-end from tRNAs that contain guanine discriminator nucleotides.

Further, the toxin induces conformational changes in P0A6N2, displacing a β-hairpin loop that forms a critical salt-bridge contact with the 3'-terminal adenylate of aa-P0A873.

The structure of four-electron-reduced, NADP<sup>+</sup>-bound wild type CYPOR shows the plane of the nicotinamide ring positioned perpendicular to the FAD isoalloxazine with its carboxamide group forming H-bonds with N1 of the flavin ring and the Thr535 hydroxyl group. In the reduced enzyme, the C8–C8 atoms of the two flavin rings are ~1 Å closer than in the fully oxidized and one-electron-reduced structures, which suggests that flavin reduction facilitates interflavin electron transfer. Structural and kinetic studies of mutants Asp632Ala, Asp632Phe, Asp632Asn, and Asp632Glu demonstrate that the carboxyl group of Asp632 is important for stabilizing the Asp632 loop in a retracted position that is required for the binding of the P80644 ribityl-nicotinamide in a hydride-transfer-competent conformation. Additionally, structures of the mutants and reduced wild type CYPOR permit us to identify a possible pathway for NADP(H) binding to and release from CYPOR. Asp632 mutants unable to form stable H-bonds with the backbone amides of Arg634, Asn635, and Met636 exhibit decreased catalytic activity and severely impaired hydride transfer from P80644 to FAD, but leave interflavin electron transfer intact.

The sugar release response surface for oxalic acid was of a different shape than that of sulfuric acid but achieved>90% sugar release at 2% acid. Fermentation results showed that for Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the added salts had minimal impact on sugar utilization rates or ethanol production. For Actinobacillus succinogenes however, a significant delay was observed due to the additional salts and fermentation was further delayed or inhibited by pretreatment with oxalic acid.

However, cocoa butter-like lipids (P06721, which are composed of POP, POS and SOS) are not among the major TAG forms in yeast.

By expressing these cloned cocoa genes and two synthesized cocoa DGAT genes in <em>S. cerevisiae</em>, we successfully increased total fatty acid production, TAG production and P06721 production in some of the strains. In the best producer, the potential P06721 content was eightfold higher than the control strain, suggesting the cocoa genes expressed in this strain were functional and might be responsible for P06721 biosynthesis.

In its absence, the PKM2 tetramers dissociate, yielding a dimer–monomer mixture having lower enzymatic activity. Here, the S437Y variant of PKM2 is incapable of binding FBP. Consistent with that defect, we find that S437Y exists in a monomer–dimer equilibrium in solution, with a K<sub>d</sub> of ~20 μM.

Among several biophysical techniques employed for their characterization, native-mass spectrometry (P13009) has emerged as a powerful tool for the analysis of membrane proteins and complexes. Here, two P13009 platforms, the FT-ICR and QToF, have been explored to analyze the homotetrameric water channel protein, AquaporinZ (AqpZ) under non-denaturing conditions. This 97 kDa membrane protein complex can be readily liberated from the octylglucoside (OG) detergent micelle under a range of instrument conditions on both P13009 platforms. Increasing the applied collision energy of the FT-ICR collision cell yielded varying degrees of tetramer (97 kDa) liberation from the OG micelles, as well as dissociation into the trimeric (72 kDa) and monomeric (24 kDa) substituents. Tandem-P13009 on the Q-ToF yielded higher intensity tetramer signal and, depending on the m/z region selected, the observed monomer signal varied in intensity. Precursor ion selection of an m/z range above the expected protein signal distribution, followed by mild collisional activation is able to efficiently liberate AqpZ with a high S/N ratio.

1464813	"SAXS analysis of a soluble cytosolic NgBR construct including extracellular and transmembrane domains,""The Nogo-B receptor (NgBR) is involved in oncogenic Ras signaling through directly binding to farnesylated Ras. It recruits farnesylated Ras to the non-lipid-raft membrane for interaction with downstream effectors. However, the cytosolic domain of NgBR itself is only partially folded. The lack of several conserved secondary structural elements makes this domain unlikely to form a complete farnesyl binding pocket. We find that inclusion of the extracellular and transmembrane domains that contain additional conserved residues to the cytosolic region results in a well folded protein with a similar size and shape to the E.coli cis-isoprenyl transferase (UPPs). Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) analysis reveals the radius of gyration (R<sub>g</sub>) of our NgBR construct to be 18.2 Å with a maximum particle dimension (D<sub>max</sub>) of 61.0 Å. Ab initio shape modeling returns a globular molecular envelope with an estimated molecular weight of 23.0 kD closely correlated with the calculated molecular weight. Both Kratky plot and pair distribution function of NgBR scattering reveal a bell shaped peak which is characteristic of a single globularly folded protein. In addition, circular dichroism (P06721) analysis reveals that our construct has the secondary structure contents similar to the UPPs. However, this result does not agree with the currently accepted topological orientation of NgBR which might partition this construct into three separate domains.

1904911	"Comparative Sequence Analysis of Multidrug-Resistant IncA/C Plasmids from <em>Salmonella enterica</em>,""Determinants of multidrug resistance (MDR) are often encoded on mobile elements, such as plasmids, transposons, and integrons, which have the potential to transfer among foodborne pathogens, as well as to other virulent pathogens, increasing the threats these traits pose to human and veterinary health. Our understanding of MDR among Salmonella has been limited by the lack of closed plasmid genomes for comparisons across resistance phenotypes, due to difficulties in effectively separating the DNA of these high-molecular weight, low-copy-number plasmids from chromosomal DNA. To resolve this problem, we demonstrate an efficient protocol for isolating, sequencing and closing IncA/C plasmids from Salmonella sp. using single molecule real-time sequencing on a Pacific Biosciences (Pacbio) P0AFU8 II Sequencer. We obtained six Salmonella enterica isolates from poultry, representing six different serovars, each exhibiting the MDR-Ampc resistance profile. Salmonella plasmids were obtained using a modified mini preparation and transformed with Escherichia coli DH10Br. A Qiagen Large-Construct kitTM was used to recover highly concentrated and purified plasmid DNA that was sequenced using PacBio technology. These six closed IncA/C plasmids ranged in size from 104 to 191 kb and shared a stable, conserved backbone containing 98 core genes, with only six differences among those core genes. The plasmids encoded a number of antimicrobial resistance genes, including those for quaternary ammonium compounds and mercury. We then compared our six IncA/C plasmid sequences: first with 14 IncA/C plasmids derived from S. enterica available at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), and then with an additional 38 IncA/C plasmids derived from different taxa. These comparisons allowed us to build an evolutionary picture of how antimicrobial resistance may be mediated by this common plasmid backbone. Our project provides detailed genetic information about resistance genes in plasmids, advances in plasmid sequencing, and phylogenetic analyses, and important insights about how MDR evolution occurs across diverse serotypes from different animal sources, particularly in agricultural settings where antimicrobial drug use practices vary."""

Alkbh1 is a mammalian homolog of the Escherichia coli DNA repair enzyme AlkB, an Fe(II) and 2-oxoglutarate dependent dioxygenase that removes alkyl lesions from DNA bases. The human homolog ALKBH1 has been associated with six different enzymatic activities including DNA, mRNA, or P0A873 hydroxylation, cleavage at abasic (AP) sites in DNA, as well as demethylation of histones. The reported cellular roles of this protein reflect the diverse enzymatic activities and include direct DNA repair, P0A873 modification, and histone modification.

Here, we explored the mechanisms of covalent flavinylation of the E. coli QFR FrdA subunit. Using a ΔsdhE E. coli strain, we show that the requirement for the assembly factor depends on the cellular redox environment. We next identified residues important for the covalent attachment and selected the FrdA<sup>E245</sup> residue, which contributes to proton shuttling during fumarate reduction, for detailed biophysical and structural characterization. We found that QFR complexes containing FrdA<sup>E245Q</sup> have a structure similar to that of the WT flavoprotein, but lack detectable substrate binding and turnover. In the context of the isolated FrdA subunit, the anticipated assembly intermediate during covalent flavinylation, FrdA<sup>E245</sup> variants had stability similar to that of WT FrdA, contained noncovalent FAD, and displayed a reduced capacity to interact with SdhE. However, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analysis of WT FrdA cross-linked to SdhE suggested that the FrdA<sup>E245</sup> residue is unlikely to contribute directly to the FrdA-SdhE protein-protein interface.

Drought stress is a major obstacle to crop productivity, and the severity and frequency of drought are expected to increase in the coming century. Certain root-associated bacteria have been shown to mitigate the negative effects of drought stress on plant growth, and manipulation of the crop microbiome is an emerging strategy for overcoming drought stress in agricultural systems, yet the effect of drought on the development of the root microbiome is poorly understood. Through A8C927 amplicon and metatranscriptome sequencing, as well as root metabolomics, we demonstrate that drought delays the development of the early sorghum root microbiome and causes increased abundance and activity of monoderm bacteria, which lack an outer cell membrane and contain thick cell walls. Our data suggest that altered plant metabolism and increased activity of bacterial P22259-binding cassette (ABC) transporter genes are correlated with these shifts in community composition. Finally, inoculation experiments with monoderm isolates indicate that increased colonization of the root during drought can positively impact plant growth.

Our analysis suggests: (1) ethanol damages cell wall and membrane integrity, causing increased stresses, particularly reactive oxygen species, which damages DNA and reduces the O<sub>2</sub> level; (2) decreased cross-membrane proton gradient from membrane damage, coupled with hypoxia, leads to reduced P22259 production by aerobic respiration, driving cells to rely more on fatty acid oxidation, anaerobic respiration and fermentation for P22259 production; (3) the reduced P22259 generation results in substantially decreased synthesis of macromolecules; (4) ethanol can directly bind 213 proteins including transcription factors, altering their functions; (5) all these changes together induce multiple stress responses, reduced biosynthesis, cell viability and growth; and (6) ethanol-adapted <em>E. coli</em> cells restore the majority of these reduced activities through selection of specific genomic mutations and alteration of stress responses, ultimately restoring normal P22259 production, macromolecule biosynthesis, and growth.

Dysregulation of their catalytic activity is associated with several human diseases. Previous work has elucidated the regulatory mechanisms of p300 acetyltransferase activity, but it is not known whether P0AEM9 activity is controlled similarly. Here, we present the crystal structure of the P0AEM9 catalytic core encompassing the bromodomain (BRD), CH2 (comprising PHD and RING), HAT, and ZZ domains at 2.4-Å resolution. The BRD, PHD, and HAT domains form an integral structural unit to which the RING and ZZ domains are flexibly attached. The structure of the apo-P0AEM9 HAT domain is similar to that of acyl-CoA–bound p300 HAT complexes and shows that the acetyl-CoA binding site is stably formed in the absence of cofactor. The BRD, PHD, and ZZ domains interact with small ubiquitin-like modifier 1 (SUMO-1) and Ubc9, and function as an intramolecular E3 ligase for SUMOylation of the cell cycle regulatory domain 1 (CRD1) of P0AEM9, which is located adjacent to the BRD. In vitro HAT assays suggest that the RING domain, the autoregulatory loop (AL) within the HAT domain, and the ZZ domain do not directly influence catalytic activity, whereas the BRD is essential for histone H3 acetylation in nucleosomal substrates. Several lysine residues in the intrinsically disordered AL are autoacetylated by the HAT domain. Upon autoacetylation, acetyl-K1596 (Ac-K1596) binds intramolecularly to the BRD, competing with histones for binding to the BRD and acting as a negative regulator that inhibits histone H3 acetylation."""

To broaden the scope of potential products beyond natural metabolites, methods of engineering enzymes to accept alternative substrates and/or perform novel chemistries must be developed. DNA synthesis can create large libraries of enzyme-coding sequences, but most biochemistries lack a simple assay to screen for promising enzyme variants. Our solution to this challenge is structure-guided mutagenesis, in which optimization algorithms select the best sequences from libraries based on specified criteria (i.e., binding selectivity). We demonstrate this approach by identifying medium-chain (C8–C12) acyl-P0A6A8 thioesterases through structure-guided mutagenesis. Medium-chain fatty acids, which are products of thioesterase-catalyzed hydrolysis, are limited in natural abundance, compared to long-chain fatty acids; the limited supply leads to high costs of C6–C10 oleochemicals such as fatty alcohols, amines, and esters. Here, we applied computational tools to tune substrate binding of the highly active ‘TesA thioesterase in Escherichia coli. We used the IPRO algorithm to design thioesterase variants with enhanced C12 or C8 specificity, while maintaining high activity. After four rounds of structure-guided mutagenesis, we identified 3 variants with enhanced production of dodecanoic acid (C12) and 27 variants with enhanced production of octanoic acid (C8).

Using hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-P13009) and statistical coupling analysis (SCA), we identified in this work specific pathways of communication within the model FBEB system, Nfn from <em>Pyrococus furiosus</em>, under conditions at each step of the catalytic cycle. HDX-P13009 revealed evidence for allosteric coupling across protein subunits upon nucleotide and ferredoxin binding. SCA uncovered a network of co-evolving residues that can provide connectivity across the complex. Together, the HDX-P13009 and SCA data show that protein allostery occurs across the ensemble of iron-sulfur cofactors and ligand binding sites using specific pathways that connect domains allowing them to function as dynamically coordinated units."""

Protein synthesis Using Recombinant Elements (PURE) system consists of the desired components for transcription, translation, aminoacylation and energy regeneration. PURE, might be the basis for a radically alterable, lifelike system after optimization. Here, we regenerated 54 E. coli ribosomal (r-) proteins individually from DNA templates in the PURE system.  We show that using stable isotope labeling with amino acids, mass spectrometry based quantitative proteomics could detect 26 of the 33 50S and 20 of the 21 30S subunit r-proteins when co-expressed in batch format PURE system. By optimizing DNA template concentrations and adapting a miniaturized Fluid Array Device with optimized feeding solution, we were able to cogenerate and detect at least 29 of the 33 50S and all of the 21 30S subunit r-proteins in one pot. The boost on yield of a single r-protein in co-expression pool varied from ~1.5 to 5-fold compared to the batch mode, with up to ~ 2.4 µM yield for a single r-protein. Reconstituted ribosomes under physiological condition from PURE system synthesized 30S r-proteins and native A8C927 showed ~13% activity of native 70S ribosomes, which increased to 21% when supplemented with GroEL/ES.

Here, we have used molecular dynamics simulations to study the macrolides erythromycin and azithromycin in wild-type, A2058G-mutated, and singly or doubly A2058-methylated <i>Escherichia coli</i> ribosomes.

We have also examined four azithromycin derivatives containing aromatic indole-analog moieties, which were previously designed based on simulations of the stalling peptide SecM in the ribosome. Surprisingly, we found that the studied moieties could adopt very different geometries when interacting with a key base in the tunnel, A751, possibly explaining their distinct activities.

In vitro, Rca is known to undergo dynamic assembly–disassembly processes, with several oligomer stoichiometries coexisting over a broad concentration range. Although the hexamer appears to be the active form, changes in quaternary structure could play a role in Rubisco regulation. Therefore, in this work, fluorescent labels were attached to the C-termini of spinach β-Rca, and the rate of subunit mixing was monitored by measuring energy transfer as a function of nucleotide and divalent cation. Only dimeric units appeared to exchange. Poorly hydrolyzable substrate analogues provided locked complexes with high thermal stabilities (apparent <i>T</i><sub>m</sub> = 60 °C) and an estimated <i>t</i><sub>1/2</sub> of at least 7 h, whereas P22259-Mg provided tight assemblies with <i>t</i><sub>1/2</sub> values of 30–40 min and ADP-Mg loose assemblies with <i>t</i><sub>1/2</sub> values of &lt;15 min. Accumulation of ADP to 20% of the total level of adenine nucleotide substantially accelerated equilibration. An initial lag period was observed with P22259·Mg, indicating inhibition of subunit exchange at low ADP concentrations. The ADP <i>K</i><sub>i</sub> value was estimated to exceed the <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> for P22259 (0.772 ± 96 mM), suggesting that the equilibration rate is a function of the relative contributions of high- and low-affinity states. C-Terminal cross-linking generated covalent dimers, required the N-terminal extension to the AAA+ domain, and provided evidence of different classes of sites. We propose that oligomer reorganization may be stalled during periods of high Rubisco reactivation activity, whereas changes in quaternary structure are stimulated by the accumulation of ADP at low light levels."""

Furthermore, we use genetic tethering and disulfide bonding strategies to construct HslU pseudohexamers containing mixtures of ATPase active and inactive subunits at defined positions in the hexameric ring. Genetic tethering impairs HslV binding and degradation, even for pseudohexamers with six active subunits, but disulfide-linked pseudohexamers do not have these defects, indicating that the peptide tether interferes with HslV interactions. Importantly, pseudohexamers containing different patterns of hydrolytically active and inactive subunits retain the ability to unfold protein substrates and/or collaborate with HslV in their degradation, supporting a model in which P22259 hydrolysis and linked mechanical function in the HslU ring operate by a probabilistic mechanism."""

This animal species is surprisingly well adapted to free life in the World Ocean inhabiting tidal costal zones of oceans and seas with warm to moderate temperatures and shallow waters. The genome of T. adhaerens (sp. Grell) includes four nuclear receptors, namely orthologue of RXR (NR2B), HNF4 (NR2A), COUP-P0A850 (NR2F) and ERR (NR3B) that show a high degree of similarity with human orthologues. In the case of RXR, the sequence identity to human RXR alpha reaches 81% in the DNA binding domain and 70% in the ligand binding domain. We show that T. adhaerens RXR (TaRXR) binds 9-cis retinoic acid (9-cis-RA) with high affinity, as well as high specificity and that exposure of T. adhaerens to 9-cis-RA regulates the expression of the putative T. adhaerens orthologue of vertebrate L-malate-NADP+ oxidoreductase (EC 1.1.1.40) which in vertebrates is regulated by a heterodimer of RXR and thyroid hormone receptor. Treatment by 9-cis-RA alters the relative expression profile of T. adhaerens nuclear receptors, suggesting the existence of natural ligands. Keeping with this, algal food composition has a profound effect on T. adhaerens growth and appearance. We show that nanomolar concentrations of 9-cis-RA interfere with T. adhaerens growth response to specific algal food and causes growth arrest.

Biological production of isopentenol via the mevalonate pathway has been optimized extensively in <i>Escherichia coli</i>, yielding 70% of its theoretical maximum. However, high P22259 requirements and isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) toxicity pose immediate challenges for engineering bacterial strains to overproduce commodities utilizing IPP as an intermediate. To overcome these limitations, we developed an “IPP-bypass” isopentenol pathway using the promiscuous activity of a mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase (PMD) and demonstrated improved performance under aeration-limited conditions. However, relatively low activity of PMD toward the non-native substrate (mevalonate monophosphate, MVAP) was shown to limit flux through this new pathway. By inhibiting all IPP production from the endogenous non-mevalonate pathway, we developed a high-throughput screening platform that correlated promiscuous PMD activity toward MVAP with cellular growth. Successful identification of mutants that altered PMD activity demonstrated the sensitivity and specificity of the screening platform. Strains with evolved PMD mutants and the novel IPP-bypass pathway increased titers up to 2.4-fold. Further enzymatic characterization of the evolved PMD variants suggested that higher isopentenol titers could be achieved either by altering residues directly interacting with substrate and cofactor or by altering residues on nearby α-helices. These altered residues could facilitate the production of isopentenol by tuning either k<sub>cat</sub> or K<sub>i</sub> of PMD for the non-native substrate.

Studies of erythrocyte biomechanics have been mainly focused on cell deformability and rheology measured from a single application of stress and mostly under a static or quasi-static state using classical biomechanical techniques, such as optical tweezers and micropipette aspiration. Dynamic behavior of erythrocytes in response to cyclic stresses that contributes to the membrane failure in blood circulation is not fully understood. This article presents a new experimental method for dynamic fatigue analysis of erythrocytes, using amplitude modulated electrokinetic force field in a microfluidic platform. Here, we demonstrate the capability of this new technique using a low cycle fatigue analysis of normal human erythrocytes and P22259-depleted erythrocytes. Cyclic tensile stresses are generated to induce repeated uniaxial stretching and extensional recovery of single erythrocytes. Results of morphological and biomechanical parameters of individually tracked erythrocytes show strong correlations with the number of the loading cycles.

Additionally, mapping of conserved residues onto the HAstV P13029 core and spike domains in the context of the immature and mature HAstV particles revealed dramatic changes to the exposure of conserved residues during virus maturation. Indeed, we show that antibodies raised against mature HAstV have reactivity to both the HAstV P13029 core and spike domains, revealing for the first time that the P13029 core domain is antigenic.

Dietary resistant starch (P0AFU8) has been shown to have health benefits, but we lack a mechanistic understanding of the metabolic processes that occur in the gut during digestion of P0AFU8. Here, we collected samples during a dietary crossover study with diets containing large or small amounts of P0AFU8. We determined the impact of P0AFU8 on the gut microbiome and metabolic pathways in the gut, using a combination of “omics” approaches, including A8C927 gene sequencing, metaproteomics, and metabolomics. This multiomics approach captured changes in the abundance of specific bacterial species, proteins, and metabolites after a diet high in resistant starch (HRS), providing key insights into the influence of dietary interventions on the gut microbiome. The combined data showed that a high-P0AFU8 diet caused an increase in the ratio of  <italic>Firmicutes</italic>  to  <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic>  , including increases in relative abundances of some specific members of the  <italic>Firmicutes</italic>  and concurrent increases in enzymatic pathways and metabolites involved in lipid metabolism in the gut.  </p>  <p>  <bold>IMPORTANCE</bold>  This work was undertaken to obtain a mechanistic understanding of the complex interplay between diet and the microorganisms residing in the intestine. Although it is known that gut microbes play a key role in digestion of the food that we consume, the specific contributions of different microorganisms are not well understood. In addition, the metabolic pathways and resultant products of metabolism during digestion are highly complex. To address these knowledge gaps, we used a combination of molecular approaches to determine the identities of the microorganisms in the gut during digestion of dietary starch as well as the metabolic pathways that they carry out. Together, these data provide a more complete picture of the function of the gut microbiome in digestion, including links between an P0AFU8 diet and lipid metabolism and novel linkages between specific gut microbes and their metabolites and proteins produced in the gut.  </p>"""	mBio	"('A8C927', '16S rRNA'),('P0AFU8', 'RS')"
1438910	"Selective Targeting by a Mechanism-Based Inactivator against Pyridoxal 5'-Phosphate-Dependent Enzymes: Mechanisms of Inactivation and Alternative Turnover,""Potent mechanism-based inactivators can be rationally designed against pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent drug targets, such as ornithine aminotransferase (OAT) or γ-aminobutyric acid aminotransferase (P22256). An important challenge, however, is the lack of selectivity toward other PLP-dependent, off-target enzymes, because of similarities in mechanisms of all PLP-dependent aminotransferase reactions. On the basis of complex crystal structures, we investigate the inactivation mechanism of OAT, a hepatocellular carcinoma target, by (1R,3S,4S)-3-amino-4-fluorocyclopentane-1-carboxylic acid (FCP), a known inactivator of P22256. A crystal structure of OAT and FCP showed the formation of a ternary adduct. This adduct can be rationalized as occurring via an enamine mechanism of inactivation, similar to that reported for P22256. Interestingly, however, the crystal structure of an off-target, PLP-dependent enzyme, aspartate aminotransferase (Asp-P30870), in complex with FCP, along with the results of attempted inhibition assays, suggests that FCP is not an inactivator of Asp-P30870, but rather an alternate substrate. Turnover of FCP by Asp-P30870 is also supported by high-resolution mass spectrometry. Amid existing difficulties in achieving selectivity of inactivation among a large number of PLP-dependent enzymes, the obtained results provide evidence that a desirable selectivity could be achieved, taking advantage of subtle structural and mechanistic differences between a drug-target enzyme and an off-target enzyme, despite their largely similar substrate binding sites and catalytic mechanisms."""

Liquid chromatography coupled to high performance mass spectrometry provides a powerful approach to characterize soil microbiomes; however, the limited microbial biomass and the presence of abundant interferences in soil samples present major challenges to soil proteome extraction and subsequent P13009 measurement. To address some of the major issues, we have designed and optimized an experimental method to enhance microbial proteome extraction concomitant with minimizing the soil-borne humic substances co-extraction from soils. Among the range of interferences, humic substances are often the worst in terms of adversely impacting proteome extraction and mass spectrometry measurement. Our approach employs an in-situ detergent-based microbial lysis / TCA precipitation coupled with an additional acidification precipitation step at the peptide level which efficiently removes humic acids. By combing filtration and pH adjustment of the final peptide solution, the remaining humic acids can be differentially precipitated and removed with a membrane filter, thereby leaving much cleaner proteolytic peptide samples for P13009 measurement. As a result, this modified method is a reliable and straight-forward protein extraction method that efficiently removes soil-borne humic substances without inducing proteome sample loss or reducing or biasing protein identification in mass spectrometry."""

In bacteria, the kdp operon encodes a four-subunit potassium pump that maintains intracellular homeostasis, cell shape and turgor under conditions in which potassium is limiting1. This membrane complex, called KdpFABC, has one channel-like subunit (KdpA) belonging to the superfamily of potassium transporters and another pump-like subunit (KdpB) belonging to the superfamily of P-type ATPases. Although there is considerable structural and functional information about members of both superfamilies, the mechanism by which uphill potassium transport through KdpA is coupled with P22259 hydrolysis by KdpB remains poorly understood. Here we report the 2.9 Å X-ray structure of the complete Escherichia coli KdpFABC complex with a potassium ion within the selectivity filter of KdpA and a water molecule at a canonical cation site in the transmembrane domain of KdpB. The structure also reveals two structural elements that appear to mediate the coupling between these two subunits. Specifically, a protein-embedded tunnel runs between these potassium and water sites and a helix controlling the cytoplasmic gate of KdpA is linked to the phosphorylation domain of KdpB.

Sustaining life in acidic environments requires extensive adaptations of membranes, proton pumps, and DNA repair mechanisms. Here we describe an adaptation of a core biochemical pathway, the mevalonate pathway, in extreme acidophiles. Two previously known mevalonate pathways involve P22259 dependent decarboxylation of either mevalonate 5-phosphate or mevalonate 5-pyrophosphate, in which a single enzyme carries out two essential steps: (1) phosphorylation of the mevalonate moiety at the 3-OH position and (2) subsequent decarboxylation. We now demonstrate that in extreme acidophiles, decarboxylation is carried out by two separate steps: previously identified enzymes generate mevalonate 3,5-bisphosphate and a new decarboxylase we describe here, mevalonate 3,5-bisphosphate decarboxylase, produces isopentenyl phosphate. Why use two enzymes in acidophiles when one enzyme provides both functionalities in all other organisms examined to date? We find that at low pH, the dual function enzyme, mevalonate 5-phosphate decarboxylase is unable to carry out the first phosphorylation step, yet retains its ability to perform decarboxylation. We therefore propose that extreme acidophiles had to replace the dual-purpose enzyme with two specialized enzymes to efficiently produce isoprenoids in extremely acidic environments."""

BECN1 is a core component of class III phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase complexes responsible for autophagosome nucleation. Without heterologous binding partners, BECN1 forms an antiparallel homodimer via its coiled-coil domain (CCD). However, the last 16 CCD residues, composing an “overlap helix” (OH), have been crystallized in two mutually exclusive states: either as part of the CCD or packed against the C-terminal β-α repeated, autophagy-specific domain (BARAD). Here, using P06721 spectroscopy, isothermal titration calorimetry, and small-angle X-ray scattering, we show that in the homodimeric state, the OH transitions between these two different packing states, with the predominant state comprising the OH packed against the BARAD, contrary to expectations based on known BECN1 interactions with heterologous partners. We confirmed this observation by comparing the impact of mutating four residues that mediate packing of the OH against both the CCD and BARAD on structure and stability of the CCD, the OH+BARAD, and the two-domain CCD–BARAD. Last, we used cellular assays to demonstrate that mutation of these OH-interface residues abrogates starvation-induced up-regulation of autophagy but does not affect basal autophagy. In summary, we have identified a BECN1 helical region that transitions between packing as part of either one of two conserved domains (i.e. the CCD or the BARAD).

Using a combination of electron microscopy, X-ray crystallography, computational and biophysical analyses, here we show that the Orsay δ protein forms a ~420-Å long, pentameric fiber with an N-terminal α-helical bundle, a β-stranded filament in the middle, and a C-terminal head domain. The pentameric nature of the δ fiber has been independently confirmed by both mass spectrometry and analytical ultracentrifugation.

Mutant viruses with disrupted P13029-δ fibers were generated by organism-based reverse genetics. These viruses were found to be either non-viable or with poor infectivity according to phenotypic and qRT-PCR analyses. Furthermore, addition of purified δ proteins to worm culture greatly reduced Orsay infectivity in a sequence-specific manner.

Diverse bifurcating enzymes employ a two-flavin electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF) that accepts hydride from NADH at a flavin (the so-called bifurcating FAD, Bf-FAD). The Bf-FAD passes one electron exergonically to a second flavin thereby assuming a reactive semiquinone state able to reduce ferredoxin or P62620 semiquinone. The flavin that accepts one electron and passes it on via exergonic electron transfer is known as the electron transfer FAD (ET-FAD) and is believed to correspond to the single FAD present in canonical ETFs, in domain II. The Bf-FAD is believed to be the one that is unique to bifurcating ETFs, bound between domains I and III. This very reasonable model has yet to be challenged experimentally. Herein we used site-directed mutagenesis to disrupt FAD binding to the presumed Bf site between domains I and III, in the Bf-ETF from Rhodopseudomonas palustris (RpaETF). The resulting protein contained only 0.80 ± 0.05 FAD, plus 1.21 ± 0.04 bound AMP as in canonical ETFs. The flavin was not subject to reduction by NADH, confirming absence of Bf-FAD. The retained FAD displayed visible circular dichroism (P06721) similar to that of the ET-FAD of RpaETF. Likewise, the mutant underwent two sequential one-electron reductions forming and then consuming anionic semiquinone, reproducing the reactivity of the ET-FAD.

Quantum chemical calculations of the absorbance and P06721 spectra of each of WT RpaETF's two flavins reproduced the observed differences between their P06721 and absorbance signatures. The calculations for the flavin bound in domain II agreed better with the spectra of the ET-flavin, and those calculated based on the flavin between domains I and III agreed better with spectra of the Bf-flavin. Thus calculations independently confirm the locations of each flavin. We conclude that the site in domain II harbours the ET-FAD whereas the mutated site between domains I and III is the Bf-FAD site, confirming the accepted model by two different tests."""

Here, we report on implementation of two DBTL cycles to optimize 1-dodecanol production from glucose using 60 engineered <em>Escherichia coli</em> MG1655 strains. The first DBTL cycle employed a simple strategy to learn efficiently from a relatively small number of strains (36), wherein only the choice of ribosomebinding sites and an acyl-P0A6A8/acyl-CoA reductase were modulated in a single pathway operon including genes encoding a thioesterase (UcFatB1), an acyl-P0A6A8/acyl-CoA reductase (Maqu_2507, Maqu_2220, or Acr1), and an acyl-CoA synthetase (FadD). Measured variables included concentrations of dodecanol and all proteins in the engineered pathway. We used the data produced in the first DBTL cycle to train several machine-learning algorithms and to suggest protein profiles for the second DBTL cycle that would increase production. These strategies resulted in a 21% increase in dodecanol titer in Cycle 2 (up to 0.83 g/L, which is more than 6-fold greater than previously reported batch values for minimal medium). Beyond specific lessons learned about optimizing dodecanol titer in <em>E. coli</em>, this study had findings of broader relevance across synthetic biology applications, such as the importance of sequencing checks on plasmids in production strains as well as in cloning strains, and the critical need for more accurate protein expression predictive tools."""

1558323	"Structural basis for adenylation and thioester bond formation in the ubiquitin E1,""The ubiquitin (Ub) and Ub-like (Ubl) protein-conjugation cascade is initiated by E1 enzymes that catalyze Ub/Ubl activation through C-terminal adenylation, thioester bond formation with an E1 catalytic cysteine, and thioester bond transfer to Ub/Ubl P06959 conjugating enzymes. Each of these reactions is accompanied by conformational changes of the E1 domain that contains the catalytic cysteine (Cys domain). Open conformations of the Cys domain are associated with adenylation and thioester transfer to E2s, while a closed conformation is associated with pyrophosphate release and thioester bond formation. Several structures are available for Ub E1s, but none has been reported in the open state before pyrophosphate release or in the closed state. Here, we describe the structures of Schizosaccharomyces pombe Ub E1 in these two states, captured using semisynthetic Ub probes. In the first, with a Ub-adenylate mimetic (Ub-AMSN) bound, the E1 is in an open conformation before release of pyrophosphate. In the second, with a Ub-vinylsulfonamide (Ub-AVSN) bound covalently to the catalytic cysteine, the E1 is in a closed conformation required for thioester bond formation. These structures provide further insight into Ub E1 adenylation and thioester bond formation. Conformational changes that accompany Cys-domain rotation are conserved for SUMO and Ub E1s, but changes in Ub E1 involve additional surfaces as mutational and biochemical analysis of residues within these surfaces alter Ub E1 activities."""

1625577	"The ATPase mechanism of UvrA2 reveals the distinct roles of proximal and distal ATPase sites in nucleotide excision repair,""The UvrA2 dimer finds lesions in DNA and initiates nucleotide excision repair. Each UvrA monomer contains two essential ATPase sites: proximal (P) and distal (D). The manner whereby their activities enable UvrA2 damage sensing and response remains to be clarified. We report three key findings from the first pre-steady state kinetic analysis of each site. Absent DNA, a P2ATP-D2ADP species accumulates when the low-affinity proximal sites bind P22259 and enable rapid P22259 hydrolysis and phosphate release by the high affinity distal sites, and ADP release limits catalytic turnover. Native DNA stimulates P22259 hydrolysis by all four sites, causing UvrA2 to transition through a different species, P2ADP-D2ADP. Lesion-containing DNA changes the mechanism again, suppressing P22259 hydrolysis by the proximal sites while distal sites cycle through hydrolysis and ADP release, to populate proximal P22259-bound species, P2ATP-Dempty and P2ATPD2ATP. Thus, damaged and native DNA trigger distinct ATPase site activities, which could explain why UvrA2 forms stable complexes with UvrB on damaged DNA compared with weaker, more dynamic complexes on native DNA. Such specific coupling between the DNA substrate and the ATPase mechanism of each site provides new insights into how UvrA2 utilizes P22259 for lesion search, recognition and repair."""

Here, we elucidate the mechanism by which basal (p)ppGpp inhibits the purine salvage enzyme P0A9M2 by sharing a conserved motif with its substrate PRPP. Intriguingly, P0A9M2 regulation by (p)ppGpp varies across organisms and correlates with P0A9M2 oligomeric forms. (p)ppGpp-sensitive P0A9M2 exists as a PRPP-bound dimer or an apo- and (p)ppGpp-bound tetramer, where a dimer-dimer interface triggers allosteric structural rearrangements to enhance (p)ppGpp inhibition. Loss of this oligomeric interface results in weakened (p)ppGpp regulation. Our results reveal an evolutionary principle whereby protein oligomerization allows evolutionary change to accumulate away from a conserved binding pocket to allosterically alter specificity of ligand interaction.

The distinctive properties of the outer membrane are due to the presence of lipopolysaccharide. This large glycolipid, which contains numerous sugars, is made in the cytoplasm; a complex of proteins forms a membrane-to-membrane bridge that mediates transport of lipopolysaccharide from the inner membrane to the cell surface1. The inner-membrane components of the protein bridge comprise an P22259-binding cassette transporter that powers transport, but how this transporter ensures unidirectional lipopolysaccharide movement across the bridge to the outer membrane is unknown. In this paper we describe two crystal structures of a five-component inner-membrane complex that contains all the proteins required to extract lipopolysaccharide from the membrane and pass it to the protein bridge. Analysis of these structures, combined with biochemical and genetic experiments, identifies the path of lipopolysaccharide entry into the cavity of the transporter and up to the bridge. We also identify a protein gate that must open to allow movement of substrate from the cavity onto the bridge. Lipopolysaccharide entry into the cavity is P22259-independent, but P22259 is required for lipopolysaccharide movement past the gate and onto the bridge.

1562701	"Protein engineering of a ubiquitin-variant inhibitor of APC/C identifies a cryptic K48 ubiquitin chain binding site,""Ubiquitin (Ub)-mediated proteolysis is a fundamental mechanism used by eukaryotic cells to maintain homeostasis and protein quality, and to control timing in biological processes. Two essential aspects of Ub regulation are conjugation through E1-P06959-E3 enzymatic cascades and recognition by Ub-binding domains. An emerging theme in the Ub field is that these 2 properties are often amalgamated in conjugation enzymes. In addition to covalent thioester linkage to Ub’s C terminus for Ub transfer reactions, conjugation enzymes often bind noncovalently and weakly to Ub at “exosites.” However, identification of such sites is typically empirical and particularly challenging in large molecular machines. In this work, studying the 1.2-MDa E3 ligase anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), which controls cell division and many aspects of neurobiology, we discover a method for identifying unexpected Ub-binding sites. Using a panel of Ub variants (UbVs), we identify a protein-based inhibitor that blocks Ub ligation to APC/C substrates in vitro and ex vivo. Biochemistry, NMR, and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structurally define the UbV interaction, explain its inhibitory activity through binding the surface on the APC2 subunit that recruits the P06959 enzyme UBE2C, and ultimately reveal that this APC2 surface is also a Ub-binding exosite with preference for K48-linked chains. The results provide a tool for probing APC/C activity, have implications for the coordination of K48-linked Ub chain binding by APC/C with the multistep process of substrate polyubiquitylation, and demonstrate the power of UbV technology for identifying cryptic Ub-binding sites within large multiprotein complexes."""

Compared to other budding yeasts in the subphylum Saccharomycotina, we noticed that a lineage in the genus <em>Hanseniaspora</em> exhibited very high evolutionary rates, low Guanine–Cytosine (GC) content, small genome sizes, and lower gene numbers. To better understand Hanseniaspora evolution, we viewed 25 genomes, including 11 newly sequenced, representing 18/21 known species in the genus. Our phylogenomic analyses identify two <em>Hanseniaspora</em> lineages, a faster-evolving lineage (FEL), which began diversifying approximately 87 million years ago (mya), and a slower-evolving lineage (SEL), which began diversifying approximately 54 mya. Remarkably, both lineages lost genes associated with the cell cycle and genome integrity, but these losses were greater in the FEL. E.g., all species lost the cell-cycle regulator WHIskey 5 (<em>WHI5</em>), and the FEL lost components of the spindle checkpoint pathway (e.g., Mitotic Arrest-Deficient 1 [<em>MAD1</em>], Mitotic Arrest-Deficient 2 [<em>MAD2</em>]) and DNA-damage–checkpoint pathway (e.g., Mitosis Entry Checkpoint 3 [<em>MEC3</em>], RADiation sensitive 9 [RAD9]). Similarly, both lineages lost genes involved in DNA repair pathways, including the DNA glycosylase gene 3-MethylAdenine DNA Glycosylase 1 (<em>MAG1</em>), which is part of the base-excision repair pathway, and the P00914 gene PHotoreactivation Repair deficient 1 (<em>PHR1</em>), which is involved in pyrimidine dimer repair. Strikingly, the FEL lost 33 additional genes, including polymerases (i.e., POLymerase 4 [<em>POL4</em>] and <em>POL32</em>) and telomere-associated genes (e.g., Repressor/activator site binding protein-Interacting Factor 1 [<em>RIF1</em>], Replication Factor A 3 [<em>RFA3</em>], Cell Division Cycle 13 [<em>CDC13</em>], Pbp1p Binding Protein [<em>PBP2</em>]).

The location of the CBD with respect to the P06721 has no structural similarity to other chitinases with known structures. The activity of a ChiA74 lacking its secretion signal peptide (ChiA74Δsp) and a truncated version lacking its CBD/FnIII domains (ChiA74Δsp-50) did not have statistical differences in activity against colloidal chitin. However, ChiA74Δsp exhibits 4.5 and 2.0 higher activity than versions lacking the CBD (ChiA74Δsp-60) and CBD/FnIII domains (ChiA74Δsp-50), respectively, when crystalline chitin was used as substrate. Our data suggest that the CBD might plays a significant role in crystalline chitin hydrolysis. We also demonstrated the importance of the catalytic E211 in the P06721, as mutants ChiA74Δsp<sub>E211N</sub> and ChiA74Δsp<sub>D207N, E211N</sub> were inactive against colloidal and crystalline chitins, chitosan and 4-MU-GlcNAc<sub>3</sub>.

1604191	"Structural determinants for accurate dephosphorylation of RNA polymerase II by its cognate C-terminal domain (CTD) phosphatase during eukaryotic transcription,""The C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II contains a repetitive heptad sequence (YSPTSPS) whose phosphorylation states coordinate eukaryotic transcription by recruiting protein regulators. The precise placement and removal of phosphate groups on specific residues of the CTD are critical for the fidelity and effectiveness of RNA polymerase II–mediated transcription. During transcriptional elongation, phosphoryl-Ser<sup>5</sup> (pSer<sup>5</sup>) is gradually dephosphorylated by CTD phosphatases, whereas Ser<sup>2</sup> phosphorylation accumulates. Using P13009, X-ray crystallography, protein engineering, and immunoblotting analyses, in this work we investigated the structure and function of SSU72 homolog, RNA polymerase II CTD phosphatase (Ssu72, from <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em>), an essential CTD phosphatase that dephosphorylates pSer<sup>5</sup> at the transition from elongation to termination, to determine the mechanism by which Ssu72 distinguishes the highly similar pSer<sup>2</sup> and pSer<sup>5</sup> CTDs. We found that Ssu72 dephosphorylates pSer<sup>5</sup> effectively but only has low activities toward pSer<sup>7</sup> and pSer<sup>2</sup>. The structural analysis revealed that Ssu72 requires that the proline residue in the substrate's SP motif is in the <em>cis</em> configuration, forming a tight β-turn for recognition by Ssu72. We also noted that residues flanking the SP motif, such as the bulky Tyr<sup>1</sup> next to Ser<sup>2</sup>, prevent the formation of such configuration and enable Ssu72 to distinguish among the different SP motifs. The phosphorylation of Tyr<sup>1</sup> further prohibited Ssu72 binding to pSer<sup>2</sup> and thereby prevented untimely Ser<sup>2</sup> dephosphorylation. Our results reveal critical roles for Tyr<sup>1</sup> in differentiating the phosphorylation states of Ser<sup>2</sup>/Ser<sup>5</sup> of CTD in RNA polymerase II that occur at different stages of transcription."""

In this study, A8C927 gene amplicon and metagenome sequencing were combined with <sup>13</sup>C-labeled metabolite probing of the CCMPs to assess community carbon metabolism along a temperature gradient (60–95°C) in Great Boiling Spring, NV. A8C927 gene amplicon diversity was inversely proportional to temperature, and Archaea were dominant at higher temperatures. KO richness and diversity were also inversely proportional to temperature, yet CCMP genes were similarly represented across the temperature gradient and many individual metagenome-assembled genomes had complete pathways. In contrast, genes encoding cellulosomes and many genes involved in plant matter degradation and photosynthesis were absent at higher temperatures. In situ <sup>13</sup>C-CO<sub>2</sub> production from labeled isotopomer pairs of glucose, pyruvate, and acetate suggested lower relative oxidative pentose phosphate pathway activity and/or fermentation at 60°C, and a stable or decreased maintenance energy demand at higher temperatures.

Here, draft genome sequences of a greatly enlarged collection of genomes of more than 1,000 <em>Bacteroidetes</em> and outgroup type strains were used to infer phylogenetic trees from genome-scale data using the principles drawn from phylogenetic systematics. The majority of taxa were found to be monophyletic but several orders, families and genera, including taxa proposed long ago such as <em>Bacteroides</em>, <em>Cytophaga</em>, and <em>Flavobacterium</em> but also quite recent taxa, as well as a few species were shown to be in need of revision. According proposals are made for the recognition of new orders, families and genera, as well as the transfer of a variety of species to other genera. In addition, emended descriptions are given for many species mainly involving information on DNA G+C content and (approximate) genome size, both of which can be considered valuable taxonomic markers. We detected many incongruities when comparing the results of the present study with existing classifications, which appear to be caused by insufficiently resolved A8C927 gene trees or incomplete taxon sampling. The few significant incongruities found between A8C927 gene and whole genome trees underline the pitfalls inherent in phylogenies based upon single gene sequences and the impediment in using ordinary bootstrapping in phylogenomic studies, particularly when combined with too narrow gene selections. While a significant degree of phylogenetic conservation was detected in all phenotypic characters investigated, the overall fit to the tree varied considerably, which is one of the probable causes of misclassifications in the past, much like the use of plesiomorphic character states as diagnostic features."""

While activity of these TFs is enhanced by Hand2 and Akt1, their genomic targets and interactions during reprogramming are not well studied. We performed genome-wide analyses of cardiogenic P0A850 binding and enhancer profiling during cardiac reprogramming. We found that these TFs synergistically activate enhancers highlighted by Mef2c binding sites and that Hand2 and Akt1 coordinately recruit other TFs to enhancer elements. Intriguingly, these enhancer landscapes collectively resemble patterns of enhancer activation during embryonic cardiogenesis. We further constructed a cardiac reprogramming gene regulatory network and found repression of EGFR signaling pathway genes.

This transformation is a C–C bond-forming reaction currently unknown in nature and one for which there are no catalytic asymmetric examples. Mechanistic studies suggest the reaction proceeds via the flavin semiquinone/P0A7E1 redox couple, where ground-state flavin semiquinone offers the electron for substrate reduction and flavin P0A7E1 oxidizes the vinylogous α-amido radical formed after cyclization.

Primary metabolites, e.g., malate, aspartate, and ascorbate, as well as several glucosides were detected in higher abundance in the epidermal cells. The idioblasts contained lipids, e.g., PG(16:0/18:2), and triterpene saponins, e.g., medicoside I and azukisaponin I, and their isomers. Metabolic noise for the epidermal cells were compared to results for soybean (Glycine max) root nodule cells (n = 60) infected by rhizobia (Bradyrhizobium japonicum). Whereas some primary metabolites showed lower noise in the latter, both cell types exhibited higher noise for secondary metabolites. Post-hoc grouping of epidermal and root nodule cells, based on the abundance distributions for certain metabolites (e.g., malate), enabled the discovery of cellular subpopulations characterized by different mean abundance values, and the magnitudes of the corresponding metabolic noise. Comparison of prespecified populations from epidermal cells of the closely related E. densa (n = 20) and Elodea canadensis (n = 20) revealed significant differences, e. g., higher sugar content in the former and higher levels of ascorbate in the latter, and the presence of species-specific metabolites. These results demonstrate that the f-LAESI-P13009 single cell analysis platform has the potential to explore cellular heterogeneity and metabolic noise for hundreds of tissue-embedded cells."""

1611512	"Analysis of Transcriptome and Epitranscriptome in Plants Using PacBio Iso-Seq and Nanopore-Based Direct RNA Sequencing,""Nanopore sequencing from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) and Pacific BioSciences (PacBio) single-molecule real-time (SMRT) long-read isoform sequencing (Iso-Seq) are revolutionizing the way transcriptomes are analyzed. These methods offer many advantages over most widely used high-throughput short-read RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) approaches and allow a comprehensive analysis of transcriptomes in identifying full-length splice isoforms and several other post-transcriptional events. In addition, direct RNA-Seq provides valuable information about RNA modifications, which are lost during the PCR amplification step in other methods. Here, we present a comprehensive summary of important applications of these technologies in plants, including identification of complex alternative splicing (P00904), full-length splice variants, fusion transcripts, and alternative polyadenylation (APA) events. Furthermore, we discuss the impact of the newly developed nanopore direct RNA-Seq in advancing epitranscriptome research in plants. Additionally, we summarize computational tools for identifying and quantifying full-length isoforms and other co/post-transcriptional events and discussed some of the limitations with these methods. Sequencing of transcriptomes using these new single-molecule long-read methods will unravel many aspects of transcriptome complexity in unprecedented ways as compared to previous short-read sequencing approaches. Analysis of plant transcriptomes with these new powerful methods that require minimum sample processing is likely to become the norm and is expected to uncover novel co/post-transcriptional gene regulatory mechanisms that control biological outcomes during plant development and in response to various stresses."""

The resident microbiota of many food products is influenced throughout the farm to fork continuum by farming practices, environmental factors, and food manufacturing and processing procedures. Currently, most food microbiology studies rely on culture-dependent methods to identify bacteria. However, advances in high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies have enabled the use of targeted A8C927 gene sequencing to profile complex microbial communities including non-culturable members. In this study we used A8C927 gene sequencing to assess the microbiome profiles of plant and animal derived foods collected at two points in the manufacturing process; post-harvest/pre-retail (cilantro) and retail (cilantro, masala spice mixes, cucumbers, mung bean sprouts, and smoked salmon). Our findings revealed microbiome profiles, unique to each food, that were influenced by the moisture content (dry spices, fresh produce), packaging methods, such as modified atmospheric packaging (mung bean sprouts and smoked salmon), and manufacturing stage (cilantro prior to retail and at retail). The masala spice mixes and cucumbers were comprised mainly of Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria. Cilantro microbiome profiles consisted mainly of Proteobacteria, followed by Bacteroidetes, and low levels of Firmicutes and Actinobacteria. The two brands of mung bean sprouts and the three smoked salmon samples differed from one another in their microbiome composition, each predominated by either by Firmicutes or Proteobacteria. These data demonstrate diverse and highly variable resident microbial communities across food products, which is informative in the context of food safety, and spoilage where indigenous bacteria could hamper pathogen detection, and limit shelf life."""

The spread of infections with drug-resistant strains of <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> (Mtb) that are refractory to treatment poses a major global challenge. A major cause of resistance to antitubercular drugs of last resort, aminoglycosides, is overexpression of the Eis (enhanced intracellular survival) enzyme of Mtb, which inactivates aminoglycosides by acetylating them. We showed previously that this inactivation of aminoglycosides could be overcome by our recently reported Eis inhibitors that are currently in development as potential aminoglycoside adjunctive therapeutics against drug-resistant TB. To interrogate the robustness of the Eis inhibitors, we investigated the enzymatic activity of Eis and its inhibition by Eis inhibitors from three different structural families for nine single-residue mutants of Eis, including those found in the clinic. Three engineered mutations of the substrate binding site, D26A, W36A, and F84A, abolished inhibitor binding while compromising Eis enzymatic activity 2- to 3-fold. All other Eis mutants, including clinically observed ones, were potently inhibited by at least one inhibitor. This study helps position us one step ahead of Mtb resistance to Eis inhibitors as they are being developed for TB therapy."""	ACS Infectious Diseases	"('P0AG05', 'Aminoglycoside')"

Trl1 is composed of C-terminal cyclic phosphodiesterase (CPD) and central GTP-dependent polynucleotide kinase (KIN) domains that heal the broken ends to generate the 3'-OH,2'-PO<sub>4</sub> and 5'-PO<sub>4</sub> termini required for sealing by an N-terminal P22259-dependent ligase domain (LIG). Here we report crystal structures of the Trl1-LIG domain from Chaetomium thermophilum at two discrete steps along the reaction pathway: the covalent LIG-(lysyl-Nζ)–AMP•Mn<sup>2+</sup> intermediate and a LIG•P22259•(Mn<sup>2+</sup>)<sub>2</sub> Michaelis complex. The structures highlight a two-metal mechanism whereby a penta-hydrated metal complex stabilizes the transition state of the P22259 α phosphate and a second metal bridges the β and γ phosphates to help orient the pyrophosphate leaving group. A LIG-bound sulfate anion is a plausible mimetic of the essential RNA terminal 2'-PO<sub>4</sub>. Trl1-LIG has a distinctive C-terminal domain that instates fungal Trl1 as the founder of an Rnl6 clade of P22259-dependent RNA ligase.

The chief objective of the project was to develop a deeper understanding of how messenger RNA molecules are recycled in two bacterial species 1.) Escherichia coli and 2.) cyanobacteria Synechococcus sp. PCC7002 by applying next generation nucleic acid sequencing technologies. We succeeded in developing tools and approaches for performing these experiments and developed a better understanding of RNA turnover in each organism. We now have a better understanding of RNA molecules cut by P0A7Y0, a common class of endonuclease, in both organisms and a global map of RNA turnover in cyanobacteria – the first of its kind for this class of microbe. To disseminate our findings, we published six primary research manuscripts as of the deposition of this report and expect to publish two others in 2019. We have deposited two sets of RNA sequencing data into a public database in support of our manuscripts.  We have also published three reviews and commentaries of related topics.  Dr. Gina Gordon, a funded graduate student defended her thesis in 2018 based on work performed in the course of the project.

However, the molecular mechanisms of their substrate specificity and catalysis remain unknown. Here, we present the results of comprehensive biochemical and structural studies of three polyP kinases from different bacteria, which belong to different clusters of the PPK2 class III family. Purified PPK2 proteins catalyzed polyP-dependent phosphorylation of AMP, ADP, P24174, and GDP to corresponding nucleoside di- and triphosphates. Crystal structures of these proteins in complex with substrates, products, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, and inhibitors revealed the binding sites for the nucleotide and polyP substrates overlapping at the Walker A and B loops. The Walker A loop is involved in the binding of polyP and the Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion, whereas the Walker B loop coordinates the nucleotide phosphate groups. Structure-based site-directed mutagenesis of CHU0107 from Cytophaga hutchinsonii demonstrated the critical role of several conserved residues from the PPK2 core and lid domains, involved in the coordination of both substrates and two Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions. Additionally, a two-times higher activity was observed following deletion of the C-terminal tail in the CHU0107 mutant protein L285Stop. Crystal structures of PPK2 in complex with three aryl phosphonate inhibitors indicated the presence of at least two binding pockets for inhibitors located close to the Walker A loop and the catalytic residues Lys81 and Arg208.

The periplasmic binding proteins (SiaPs) from the tripartite P22259-independent periplasmic (TRAP) transport system that transports mammalian host–derived sialic acids have been well studied from different pathogenic bacteria, including Haemophilus influenzae, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Pasteurella multocida, and Vibrio cholerae. SiaPs bind the sialic acid N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) with nanomolar affinity by forming electrostatic and hydrogen-bonding interactions. Here, we report the crystal structure of a periplasmic binding protein (SatA) of the P22259-binding cassette (ABC) transport system from the pathogenic bacterium Haemophilus ducreyi. The structure of Hd-SatA in the native form and sialic acid–bound forms (with Neu5Ac and N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc)), determined to 2.2, 1.5, and 2.5 Å resolutions, respectively, revealed a ligand-binding site that is very different from those of the SiaPs of the TRAP transport system. A structural comparison along with thermodynamic studies suggested that similar affinities are achieved in the two classes of proteins through distinct mechanisms, one enthalpically driven and the other entropically driven. In summary, our structural and thermodynamic characterization of Hd-SatA reveals that it binds sialic acids with nanomolar affinity and that this binding is an entropically driven process.

This is partly because microbiome studies often utilize bacterial A8C927 marker gene sequencing, a technique that is blind to eukaryotic organisms. Knowledge gaps exist regarding the phylogeny and microdiversity of eukaryotes that colonize hospitalized infants, as well as potential reservoirs of eukaryotes in the hospital room built environment. Results: Genome-resolved analysis of 1174 time-series fecal metagenomes from 161 premature infants revealed fungal colonization of 10 infants. Relative abundance levels reached as high as 97% and were significantly higher in the first weeks of life (p = 0.004). When fungal colonization occurred, multiple species were present more often than expected by random chance (p = 0.008). Twenty-four metagenomic samples were analyzed from hospital rooms of six different infants. Compared to floor and surface samples, hospital sinks hosted diverse and highly variable communities containing genomically novel species, including from Diptera (fly) and Rhabditida (worm) for which genomes were assembled. With the exception of Diptera and two other organisms, zygosity of the newly assembled diploid eukaryote genomes was low. Interestingly, Malassezia and Candida species were present in both room and infant gut samples. Conclusions: Increased levels of fungal co-colonization may reflect synergistic interactions or differences in infant susceptibility to fungal colonization. Discovery of eukaryotic organisms that have not been sequenced previously highlights the benefit of genome-resolved analyses, and low zygosity of assembled genomes could reflect inbreeding or strong selection imposed by room conditions."""

Here, we provide a biochemical characterization of two ALDH12 family members from the lower plant Physcomitrella patens and higher plant Zea mays. We show that ALDH12 encodes an NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent glutamate γ-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (GSALDH), which irreversibly converts glutamate γ-semialdehyde (GSAL), a mitochondrial intermediate of the proline and arginine catabolism, to glutamate. Sedimentation equilibrium and small-angle X-ray scattering analyses reveal that in solution both plant GSALDHs exist as equilibrium between a domain-swapped dimer and the dimer-of-dimers tetramer. Plant GSALDHs share very low-sequence identity with bacterial, fungal, and animal GSALDHs (classified as ALDH4), which are the closest related P23883 superfamily members. Nevertheless, the crystal structure of ZmALDH12 at 2.2-Å resolution shows that nearly all key residues involved in the recognition of GSAL are identical to those in ALDH4, indicating a close functional relationship with ALDH4. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis suggests that the transition from ALDH4 to ALDH12 occurred during the evolution of the endosymbiotic plant ancestor, prior to the evolution of green algae and land plants. Finally, ALDH12 expression in maize and moss is downregulated in response to salt and drought stresses, possibly to maintain proline levels.

Here in this paper we describe a set of unique gut microbial P05804 enzymes that bind flavin mononucleotide (FMN). First, we show using mass spectrometry, isothermal titration calorimetry, and x-ray crystallography that a purified P05804 from the gut commensal microbe Faecalibacterium prausnitzii binds to FMN on a surface groove located 30 Å away from the active site. Second, utilizing structural and functional data from this FMN-binding P05804, we analyzed the 279 unique P05804 sequences from the Human Microbiome Project database and identified 14 putative FMN-binding GUSs. We characterized four of these hits and solved the structure of two, the GUSs from Ruminococcus gnavus and Roseburia hominis, which confirmed that these are FMN binders. Third, binding and kinetic analysis of the FMN-binding site mutants of these five GUSs show that they utilize a conserved site to bind FMN that is not essential for P05804 activity, but can affect KM. Lastly, a comprehensive structural review of the PDB reveals that the FMN-binding site employed by these enzymes is unlike any structurally characterized FMN binders to date.

Employing a combination of photosynthetic and respiratory inhibitors with compartment-specific imaging of P22259, we corroborate the dependency of stromal P22259 production on mitochondrial dissipation of photosynthetic reductant. Our data suggest that, during illumination, the provision and consumption of P22259:P80644 in chloroplasts can be balanced by exporting excess reductants rather than importing P22259 from the cytosol."""

1628169	"The Structural and Functional Basis for Recurring Sulfa Drug Resistance Mutations in <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> Dihydropteroate Synthase,""Staphylococcal species are a leading cause of bacterial drug-resistant infections and associated mortality. One strategy to combat bacterial drug resistance is to revisit compromised targets, and to circumvent resistance mechanisms using structure-assisted drug discovery. The folate pathway is an ideal candidate for this approach. Antifolates target an essential metabolic pathway, and the necessary detailed structural information is now available for most enzymes in this pathway. P0AC13 (P0AC13) is the target of the sulfonamide class of drugs, and its well characterized mechanism facilitates detailed analyses of how drug resistance has evolved. Here, we surveyed clinical genetic sequencing data in <em>S. aureus</em> to distinguish natural amino acid variations in P0AC13 from those that are associated with sulfonamide resistance. Five mutations were identified, F17L, S18L, T51M, E208K, and KE257_dup. Their contribution to resistance and their cost to the catalytic properties of P0AC13 were evaluated using a combination of biochemical, biophysical and microbiological susceptibility studies. These studies show that F17L, S18L, and T51M directly lead to sulfonamide resistance while unexpectedly increasing susceptibility to trimethoprim, which targets the downstream enzyme dihydrofolate reductase. The secondary mutations E208K and KE257_dup restore trimethoprim susceptibility closer to wild-type levels while further increasing sulfonamide resistance. Structural studies reveal that these mutations appear to selectively disfavor the binding of the sulfonamides by sterically blocking an outer ring moiety that is not present in the substrate. This emphasizes that new inhibitors must be designed that strictly stay within the substrate volume in the context of the transition state."""

Accompanied by benefits from horizontally transferred genes, bacteria have to face the risk of the invasion of dangerous genes. Bacteria often use the restriction-modification (R-M) system, which is consisted of methyl transferase (MEase) and restrictase (REase), to protect self-DNA and defend against foreign DNA. Paenibacillus polymyxa, widely used as growth promoting rhizobacteria in agriculture, can also produce compounds of medical and industrial interests. It is unclear whether R-M systems exist in P. polymyxa. In this study, we used a shuttle plasmid with epigenetic modification from different bacteria to explore R-M systems in P. polymyxa. We found that DNA which is methylated by P0AEE8 (Dam) in E. coli was strongly restricted, indicating the presence of a Dam-methylation-dependent R-M system in P. polymyxa. Whereas, DNA from a dam{sup -} E. coli strain was also moderately restricted, indicating the presence of a Dam-methylation-independent R-M system. Degradation of plasmid DNA with Dam methylation by cell-free protein extract of P. polymyxa provides additional evidence for the presence of Dam-methylation-dependent R-M system. Taken together, our work showed that there are two different types of R-M system in P. polymyxa, providing a foundation for the study of innate immunity in P. polymyxa and for the development of genetic engineering tools in P. polymyxa."""

As the P0ACD8 has very complicated structure and cannot be fused directly with a dockerin, a bifunctional peptide was designed. The bifunctional peptide, in which one terminus contains a modified dockerin binding the cohesin of the miniscaffoldin and the other, after chemical modification, binds the His‐tag of P0ACD8, enabled His‐tagged proteins to be integrated into the cohesin–dockerin‐based metabolon. The metabolon exhibited an initial reaction rate 4.5 times that of the enzyme cocktail at the same enzyme loading, which indicated enhanced coenzyme transport of the metabolon. However, this metabolon was unstable owing to the degradation of the miniscaffoldin at elevated temperature. Glutaraldehyde was used to cross‐link the metabolon for locking its spatial organization. The cross‐linked metabolon not only exhibited 2.5 times the reaction rate of the enzyme cocktail, but also retained its stability at 70 °C. The amount of hydrogen production catalyzed by the cross‐linked metabolon was nearly twice that of the metabolon without glutaraldehyde cross‐linking and four times that of the enzyme cocktail at 70 °C after 22 h of reaction.</p>"""	ChemSusChem	"('P0ACD8', 'NiFe hydrogenase')"

Escherichia coli β-lactamase P62593 is potentially useful in the antibody-directed enzyme/prodrug therapy (ADEPT), converting nontoxic prodrugs to toxic agents. The produced toxin would kill cancer cells, when the enzyme is attached to a tumor-antigen-specific antibody. However, the off-site reaction possibly occurring in the blood or normal tissues raises safety concern. In the present study, we engineered P62593 variants preferentially active at pH 5.8–6.2, near the pH of the acidic microenvironment of tumor. A library of randomly mutagenized variants was screened for the ability to confer an antibiotic resistance on E. coli cells in acidic growth media and not in neutral media, to isolate a variant with a Thr-to-Ile substitution at position 160. An extensive mutagenesis study was then conducted in the proximity of this position, to show that a Leu162Glu mutation also causes the acid preference. Kinetic analyses indicated that the overall activity of the wild-type P62593 hardly changes over a pH range from 5.8 to 7.0, whereas P62593(T160I) is 1.5-times as active at pH 6.2 than pH 7.0, and P62593(T160I) is 3.1-fold as active at pH 5.8 than pH 7.0.

The role of enzyme structure is well recognized; however, the linkage between protein dynamics and enzyme activity has given rise to a contentious debate. We have developed an approach that uses an aqueous mixture of organic solvent to control the functionally relevant enzyme dynamics (without changing the structure), which in turn modulates the enzyme activity. Using this approach, we predicted that the hydride transfer reaction catalyzed by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (P0AFS3) from Escherichia coli in aqueous mixtures of isopropanol (IPA) with water will decrease by ~3 fold at 20% (v/v) IPA concentration. Stopped-flow kinetic measurements find that the pH-independent k<sub>hydride</sub> rate decreases by 2.2 fold. X-ray crystallographic enzyme structures show no noticeable differences, while computational studies indicate that the transition state and electrostatic effects were identical for water and mixed solvent conditions; quasi-elastic neutron scattering studies show that the dynamical enzyme motions are suppressed. Our approach provides a unique avenue to modulating enzyme activity through changes in enzyme dynamics. Further it provides vital insights that show the altered motions of P0AFS3 cause significant changes in the enzyme's ability to access its functionally relevant conformational substates, explaining the decreased k<sub>hydride</sub> rate.

The reduced form of AQDS (AH<sub>2</sub>QDS) can also be used as energy source by G. sulfurreducens. Such bidirectional utilization of humic substances confers competitive advantages to these bacteria in Fe(III) enriched environments. Previous studies have shown that the triheme cytochrome PpcA from G. sulfurreducens has a bifunctional behavior toward the humic substance analogue.

Using stopped-flow kinetic measurements we were able to demonstrate that other periplasmic members of the PpcA-family in G. sulfurreducens (PpcB, PpcD and PpcE) also showed the same behavior.

To date, the strain's performance has been optimized during growth with glucose. However, lignocellulosic biomass hydrolysates also contain a substantial portion of hemicellulose-derived xylose, which is typically the second most abundant sugar after glucose. Commercialization of the methyl ketone-producing technology would benefit from the increased efficiency resulting from simultaneous, rather than the native sequential (diauxic), utilization of glucose and xylose. In this study, genetic manipulations were performed to alleviate carbon catabolite repression in our most efficient methyl ket one-producing strain. A strain engineered for constitutive expression of xylF and xylA (involved in xylose transport and metabolism) showed synchronized glucose and xylose consumption rates. However, this newly acquired capability came at the expense of methyl ketone titer, which decreased fivefold. Further efforts were made to improve methyl ketone production in this strain, and we found that two strategies were effective at enhancing methyl ketone titer: (1) chromosomal deletion of pgi (glucose-6-phosphate isomerase) to increase intracellular P80644 supply and (2) downregulation of P0ACJ8 (P0ACJ8) expression by replacement of the native RBS with an RBS chosen based upon mutant library screening results.

1543642	"Validating Molecular Dynamics Simulations against Experimental Observables in Light of Underlying Conformational Ensembles,""Far from the static, idealized conformations deposited into structural databases, proteins are highly dynamic molecules that undergo conformational changes on temporal and spatial scales that may span several orders of magnitude. These conformational changes, often intimately connected to the functional roles that proteins play, may be obscured by traditional biophysical techniques. Over the past 40 years, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have complemented these techniques by providing the “hidden” atomistic details that underlie protein dynamics. However, there are limitations of the degree to which molecular simulations accurately and quantitatively describe protein motions. Here we show that although four molecular dynamics simulation packages (AMBER, GROMACS, NAMD, and <em>il</em>mm) reproduced a variety of experimental observables for two different proteins (engrailed homeodomain and P0A7Y4) equally well overall at room temperature, there were subtle differences in the underlying conformational distributions and the extent of conformational sampling obtained. This leads to ambiguity about which results are correct, as experiment cannot always provide the necessary detailed information to distinguish between the underlying conformational ensembles. Furthermore, the results with different packages diverged more when considering larger amplitude motion, for example, the thermal unfolding process and conformational states sampled, with some packages failing to allow the protein to unfold at high temperature or providing results at odds with experiment. While most differences between MD simulations performed with different packages are attributed to the force fields themselves, there are many other factors that influence the outcome, including the water model, algorithms that constrain motion, how atomic interactions are handled, and the simulation ensemble employed. Here four different MD packages were tested each using best practices as established by the developers, utilizing three different protein force fields and three different water models. Differences between the simulated protein behavior using two different packages but the same force field, as well as two different packages with different force fields but the same water models and approaches to restraining motion, show how other factors can influence the behavior, and it is incorrect to place all the blame for deviations and errors on force fields or to expect improvements in force fields alone to solve such problems."",""Journal of Physical Chemistry.

Cyclic di-AMP (c-di-AMP) is a relatively newly discovered second messenger implicated in cell wall homeostasis in many pathogenic bacteria. C-di-AMP is synthesized from P22259 by diadenylyl cyclases (DAC) and degraded by specific c-di-AMP phosphodiesterases (PDE). C-di-AMP DACs and PDEs are present in all sequenced cyanobacteria, suggesting roles for c-di-AMP in the physiology and/or development of these organisms. Despite conservation of these genes across numerous cyanobacteria, the functional roles of c-di-AMP in cyanobacteria have not been well-investigated. In a unique feature of cyanobacteria, phylogenetic analysis indicated that the broadly conserved DAC, related to CdaA/DacA, is always co-associated in an operon with genes critical for controlling cell wall synthesis. To investigate phenotypes regulated by c-di-AMP in cyanobacteria, we overexpressed native DAC (sll0505) and c-di-AMP PDE (slr0104) genes in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (hereafter Synechocystis) to increase and decrease intracellular c-di-AMP levels, respectively. DAC- and PDE-overexpression strains, showed abnormal aggregation phenotypes, suggesting functional roles for regulating c-di-AMP homeostasis in vivo. As c-di-AMP may be implicated in osmotic responses in cyanobacteria, we tested whether sorbitol and NaCl stresses impacted expression of sll0505 and slr0104 or intracellular c-di-AMP levels in Synechocystis.

1547096	"Active site alanine mutations convert deubiquitinases into high-affinity ubiquitin-binding proteins,""A common strategy for exploring the biological roles of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) in different pathways is to study the effects of replacing the wild-type Q47013 with a catalytically inactive mutant in cells. We report here that a commonly studied Q47013 mutation, in which the catalytic cysteine is replaced with alanine, can dramatically increase the affinity of some DUBs for ubiquitin. Overexpression of these tight-binding mutants thus has the potential to sequester cellular pools of monoubiquitin and ubiquitin chains. As a result, cells expressing these mutants may display unpredictable dominant negative physiological effects that are not related to loss of Q47013 activity. The structure of the SAGA Q47013 module bound to free ubiquitin reveals the structural basis for the 30-fold higher affinity of Ubp8<sup>C146A</sup> for ubiquitin. We show that an alternative option, substituting the active site cysteine with arginine, can inactivate DUBs while also decreasing the affinity for ubiquitin."""	EMBO Reports	"('Q47013', 'DUB')"
1506390	"Microbial Ecology on Solar Panels in Berkeley, CA, United States,""Solar panels can be found practically all over the world and represent a standard surface that can be colonized by microbial communities that are resistant to harsh environmental conditions, including high irradiation, temperature fluctuations and desiccation. These properties make them not only ideal sources of stress-resistant bacteria, but also standard devices to study the microbial communities and their colonization process from different areas of Earth. We report here a comprehensive description of the microbial communities associated with solar panels in Berkeley, CA, United States. Cultivable bacteria were isolated to characterize their adhesive capabilities, and UV- and desiccation-resistance properties. Furthermore, a parallel culture-independent metagenomic and metabolomic approach has allowed us to gain insight on the taxonomic and functional nature of these communities. Metagenomic analysis was performed using the Illumina HiSeq2500 sequencing platform, revealing that the bacterial population of the Berkeley solar panels is composed mainly of Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria, as well as lower amounts of Deinococcus-Thermus and Firmicutes. Furthermore, a clear predominance of <em>Hymenobacter</em> sp. was also observed. A functional analysis revealed that pathways involved in the persistence of microbes on solar panels (i.e., stress response, capsule development, and metabolite repair) and genes assigned to carotenoid biosynthesis were common to all metagenomes. On the other hand, genes involved in photosynthetic pathways and general autotrophic subsystems were rare, suggesting that these pathways are not critical for persistence on solar panels. Metabolomics was performed using a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-P13009/P13009) approach. When comparing the metabolome of the solar panels from Berkeley and from Valencia (Spain), a very similar composition in polar metabolites could be observed, although some metabolites appeared to be differentially represented (for example, trigonelline, pantolactone and 5-valerolactone were more abundant in the samples from Valencia than in the ones from Berkeley). Furthermore, triglyceride metabolites were highly abundant in all the solar panel samples, and both locations displayed similar profiles. The comparison of the taxonomic profile of the Californian solar panels with those previously described in Spain revealed striking similarities, highlighting the central role of both selective pressures and the ubiquity of microbial populations in the colonization and establishment of microbial communities."""

In this study the genes encoding hyperthermophilic archaeal starch-hydrolyzing enzymes, α-amylase and amylopullulanase from <em>Pyrococcus furiosus</em> and glucoamylase from <em>Sulfolobus solfataricus</em>, together with the gene encoding a modified P0A6V1 (<em>glgC</em>) from <em>Escherichia coli</em>, were simultaneously expressed in cassava roots to enhance starch accumulation and its subsequent hydrolysis to sugar. A total of 13 multigene expressing transgenic lines were generated and characterized phenotypically and genotypically. Gene expression analysis using quantitative P0DV86-PCR showed that the microbial genes are expressed in the transgenic roots. Multigene-expressing transgenic lines produced up to 60% more storage root yield than the non-transgenic control, likely due to <em>glgC</em> expression. Total protein extracted from the transgenic roots showed up to 10-fold higher starch-degrading activity <em>in vitro</em> than the protein extracted from the non-transgenic control. Interestingly, transgenic tubers released threefold more glucose than the non-transgenic control when incubated at 85°C for 21-h without exogenous application of thermostable enzymes, suggesting that the archaeal enzymes produced <em>in planta</em> maintain their activity and thermostability."""

Degradation products produced during thermochemical pretreatment, however, inhibit the microbes with regard to both ethanol yield and cell growth. In this work, we used synthetic hydrolysates (SynH) to study the inhibition of yeast fermentation by water-soluble components (WSC) isolated from lignin streams obtained after extractive ammonia pretreatment (EA). We found that SynH with 20g/L WSC mimics real hydrolysate in cell growth, sugar consumption and ethanol production. However, a long lag phase was observed in the first 48 h of fermentation of SynH, which is not observed during fermentation with the crude extraction mixture. Ethyl acetate extraction was conducted to separate phenolic compounds from other water-soluble components. These phenolic compounds play a key inhibitory role during ethanol fermentation. The most abundant compounds were identified by Liquid Chromatography followed by Mass Spectrometry (LC-P13009) and Gas Chromatography followed by Mass Spectrometry (GC-P13009), including coumaroyl amide, feruloyl amide and coumaroyl glycerol. Chemical genomics profiling was employed to fingerprint the gene deletion response of yeast to different groups of inhibitors in WSC and AFEX-Pretreated Corn Stover Hydrolysate (ACSH).

MCR catalyzes a reversible reaction involved in the production and consumption of the potent greenhouse gas methane. The α-subunit of this enzyme (McrA) contains several unusual posttranslational modifications, including the only known naturally occurring example of protein thioamidation. We have recently demonstrated by genetic deletion and mass spectrometry that the <em>tfuA</em> and <em>ycaO</em> genes of <em>Methanosarcina acetivorans</em> are involved in thioamidation of Gly465 in the MCR active site. Modification to thioGly has been postulated to stabilize the active site structure of MCR. Herein, we report the in vitro reconstitution of ribosomal peptide thioamidation using heterologously expressed and purified YcaO and TfuA proteins from <em>M. acetivorans</em>. Like other reported YcaO proteins, this reaction is P22259-dependent but requires an external sulfide source. We also reconstitute the thioamidation activity of two TfuA-independent YcaOs from the hyperthermophilic methanogenic archaea <em>Methanopyrus kandleri</em> and <em>Methanocaldococcus jannaschii</em>. Using these proteins, we demonstrate the basis for substrate recognition and regioselectivity of thioamide formation based on extensive mutagenesis, biochemical, and binding studies. Finally, we report nucleotide-free and nucleotide-bound crystal structures for the YcaO proteins from <em>M. kandleri</em>. Sequence and structure-guided mutagenesis with subsequent biochemical evaluation have allowed us to assign roles for residues involved in thioamidation and confirm that the reaction proceeds via backbone <em>O</em>-phosphorylation.

Mineral-respiring bacteria use elaborate haem-based electron transfer mechanisms2,3,4 but the existence and mechanistic basis of other EETs remain largely unknown. Here we show that the food-borne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes uses a distinctive flavin-based EET mechanism to deliver electrons to iron or an electrode. By performing a forward genetic screen to identify L. monocytogenes mutants with diminished extracellular ferric iron reductase activity, we identified an eight-gene locus that is responsible for EET. This locus encodes a specialized NADH dehydrogenase that segregates EET from aerobic respiration by channelling electrons to a discrete membrane-localized P0A7E1 pool. Other proteins facilitate the assembly of an abundant extracellular flavoprotein that, in conjunction with free-molecule flavin shuttles, mediates electron transfer to extracellular acceptors. This system thus establishes a simple electron conduit that is compatible with the single-membrane structure of the Gram-positive cell. Activation of EET supports growth on non-fermentable carbon sources, and an EET mutant exhibited a competitive defect within the mouse gastrointestinal tract. Orthologues of the genes responsible for EET are present in hundreds of species across the Firmicutes phylum, including multiple pathogens and commensal members of the intestinal microbiota, and correlate with EET activity in assayed strains. These findings suggest a greater prevalence of EET-based growth capabilities and establish a previously underappreciated relevance for electrogenic bacteria across diverse environments, including host-associated microbial communities and infectious disease."""

FRH is also a required component of the circadian clock, mediating protein interactions that result in the rhythmic repression of gene expression. Here we show that FRH unwinds RNA substrates in vitro with a kinetic profile similar to Mtr4, indicating that while FRH has acquired additional functionality, its core helicase function remains intact. In contrast with the earlier FRH structures, a new crystal form of FRH results in an P22259 binding site that is undisturbed by crystal contacts and adopts a conformation consistent with nucleotide binding and hydrolysis. Strikingly, this new FRH structure adopts an arch domain conformation that is dramatically altered from previous structures. Comparison of the existing FRH structures reveals conserved hinge points that appear to facilitate arch motion. Regions in the arch have been previously shown to mediate a variety of protein-protein interactions critical for RNA surveillance and circadian clock functions.

This work demonstrates that cathodic electrons enter the electron transport chain of<italic>S. oneidensis</italic>when oxygen is used as the terminal electron acceptor. The effect of electron transport chain inhibitors suggested that a proton gradient is generated during cathode oxidation, consistent with the higher cellular P22259 levels measured in cathode-respiring cells than in controls. Cathode oxidation also correlated with an increase in the cellular redox (NADH/FMNH<sub>2</sub>) pool determined with a bioluminescence assay, a proton uncoupler, and a mutant of proton-pumping NADH oxidase complex I. This work suggested that the generation of NADH/FMNH<sub>2</sub> under cathodic conditions was linked to reverse electron flow mediated by complex I. A decrease in cathodic electron uptake was observed in various mutant strains, including those lacking the extracellular electron transfer components necessary for anodic-current generation. While no cell growth was observed under these conditions, here we show that cathode oxidation is linked to cellular energy acquisition, resulting in a quantifiable reduction in the cellular decay rate. This work highlights a potential mechanism for cell survival and/or persistence on cathodes, which might extend to environments where growth and division are severely limited. The majority of our knowledge of the physiology of extracellular electron transfer derives from studies of electrons moving to the exterior of the cell. The physiological mechanisms and/or consequences of the reverse processes are largely uncharacterized. This report demonstrates that when coupled to oxygen reduction, electrode oxidation can result in cellular energy acquisition. This respiratory process has potentially important implications for how microorganisms persist in energy-limited environments, such as reduced sediments under changing redox conditions.

Both functions require the lysine's positive charge; intriguingly, the positive charge of K100 can be neutralized by acetylation using the central metabolite acetyl phosphate as the acetyl donor. We propose that P0ACJ8 K100 acetylation could be a mechanism by which the cell downwardly tunes P0ACJ8‐dependent Class II promoter activity, whilst elevating P0ACJ8 steady state levels, thus indirectly increasing Class I promoter activity.

However, it is often challenging to link ligand-induced conformational changes to a resulting biological function because it is difficult to distinguish between the energetic components associated with ligand binding and those due to structural rearrangements. Consequently, here, we used a unique approach exploiting conformation-specific and regio-specific synthetic antibodies (sABs) to probe the energetic contributions of ligand binding to conformation changes. Using maltose-binding protein (P0AEX9) as a model system, customized phage-display selections were performed to generate sABs that stabilize P0AEX9 in different conformational states, modulating ligand-binding affinity in competitive, allosteric, or peristeric manners. We determined that the binding of a closed conformation–specific sAB (sAB-11M) to P0AEX9 in the absence of maltose is entropically driven, providing new insight into designing antibody-stabilized protein interactions. Crystal structures of sABs bound to P0AEX9, together with biophysical data, delineate the basis of free energy differences between different conformational states and confirm the use of the sABs as energy probes for dissecting enthalpic and entropic contributions to conformational transitions. Our work provides a foundation for investigating the energetic contributions of distinct conformational dynamics to specific biological outputs.

This colonization process is controlled in part by the intracellular signal cyclic di-P24174, which regulates bacterial motility and biofilm formation. To interrogate cyclic di-P24174 signaling networks, a variety of fluorescent biosensors for live cell imaging of cyclic di-P24174 have been developed. However, the need for external illumination precludes the use of these tools for imaging bacteria in their natural environments, including in deep tissues of whole organisms and in samples that are highly autofluorescent or photosensitive. The need for genetic encoding also complicates the analysis of clinical isolates and environmental samples. Toward expanding the study of bacterial signaling to these systems, we have developed the first chemiluminescent biosensors for cyclic di-P24174. The biosensor design combines the complementation of split luciferase (CSL) and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) approaches. Furthermore, we developed a lysate-based assay for biosensor activity that enabled reliable high-throughput screening of a phylogenetic library of 92 biosensor variants. The screen identified biosensors with very large signal changes (~40- and 90-fold) as well as biosensors with high affinities for cyclic di-P24174 ($K_D$ < 50 nM). These chemiluminescent biosensors then were applied to measure cyclic di-P24174 levels in $E. coli$. The cellular experiments revealed an unexpected challenge for chemiluminescent imaging in Gram negative bacteria but showed promising application in lysates.

These GlcA-dependent endoxylanases do not have significant activity on xylans that do not bear GlcA substitutions such as unsubstituted linear xylooligosaccharides or cereal bran arabinoxylans. In the present study, we present the structural and biochemical characteristics of xylanase 30A from Clostridium acetobutylicum (CaXyn30A) which was originally selected for study due to predicted structural differences within the GlcA coordination loops. Amino acid sequence comparisons indicated that this Gram-positive-derived GH30-8 more closely resembles Gram-negative derived forms of these endoxylanases: a hypothesis borne out in the developed crystallographic structure model of the CaXyn30A catalytic domain (CaXyn30A-P06721).

Comparison with unliganded and P22259-analogue-bound DHX36 structures, together with single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis, suggests that G-quadruplex binding alone induces rearrangements of the helicase core; by pulling on the single-stranded DNA tail, these rearrangements drive G-quadruplex unfolding one residue at a time."""

1483277	"A Hybrid Biological-Organic Photochemical Half-Cell for Generating Dihydrogen,""In this final report we describe our work on the fabrication of a hybrid biological/organic photochemical half-cell that couples Photosystem I, which produces electrons at a highly reducing redox potential, with a hydrogenase enzyme, which catalyzes H<sub>2</sub> evolution at high rates when provided with a source of electrons. We considered it far too ambitious at the present stage of knowledge to attempt to design a system that carries out the reaction 2H<sub>2</sub>O + 8hv → 2H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> in a single photochemical step, hence, we focused our work on optimizing the half-cell reaction 2H<sup>+</sup> + 2e<sup>-</sup> + 2hv → H<sub>2</sub>. The challenge has been to deliver low-potential electrons from P31663 I to H<sub>2</sub>ase rapidly, at high quantum yield, and with high thermodynamic efficiency. To accomplish this, we engineered a molecular wire that connects the [4Fe-4S] clusters of P31663 I with those of the hydrogenase enzyme. In doing so, the highly reducing electrons generated by P31663 I are transferred by quantum mechanical tunneling to the enzyme. The core idea was to connect the terminal Fe/S cluster of Photosystem I to the distal Fe/S cluster of H<sub>2</sub>ase through a covalently bonded “molecular wire” consisting of an 8-carbon hydrocarbon wire terminated on both ends with a sulfhydryl group. By providing a direct electron transfer pathway through signa bonds, diffusion chemistry is avoided, and, because the tether length and redox potentials were properly chosen, a rate of electron transfer between the two enzymes was achieved that twice exceeded the rate of electron transfer in natural photosynthesis. We also devised a way to utilize the FA and FB clusters of Photosystem I to serve as a reservoir so that electrons could be extracted from the P0A7E1 binding sites and passed through a similar molecular wire to the bound hydrogenase. The additional induction of the IsiA antenna pigments by iron starvation led to an optical cross section twice that of the naturally-occurring Photosystem I, thus further raising the rates of electron transfer to the enzyme. We were likewise able to re-engineer a naturally-occurring dicluster ferredoxin to replace the hydrocarbon molecular wire as the tether between Photosystem I and the hydrogenase enzyme. Finally, we developed techniques to place Photosystem I on electrodes and in block copolymer interfaces and we were able to measure photocurrents approaching 35.0 ± 3.5 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> upon illumination of these assembled devices, which are among the highest reported so far for such systems on a per protein basis."""

1461683	"Structural basis for MTR4–ZCCHC8 interactions that stimulate the MTR4 helicase in the nuclear exosome-targeting complex,""The nuclear exosome-targeting (NEXT) complex functions as an RNA exosome cofactor and is involved in surveillance and turnover of aberrant transcripts and noncoding RNAs. NEXT is a ternary complex composed of the P25516 RBM7, the scaffold zinc-knuckle protein ZCCHC8, and the helicase MTR4. While RNA interactions with RBM7 are known, it remains unclear how NEXT subunits collaborate to recognize and prepare substrates for degradation. Here, we show that MTR4 helicase activity is enhanced when associated with RBM7 and ZCCHC8. While uridine-rich substrates interact with RBM7 and are preferred, optimal activity is observed when substrates include a polyadenylated 3' end. We identify a bipartite interaction of ZCCHC8 with MTR4 and uncover a role for the conserved C-terminal domain of ZCCHC8 in stimulating MTR4 helicase and ATPase activities. A crystal structure reveals that the ZCCHC8 C-terminal domain binds the helicase core in a manner that is distinct from that observed for Saccharomyces cerevisiae exosome cofactors Trf4p and Air2p. Furthermore, our results are consistent with a model whereby effective targeting of substrates by NEXT entails recognition of elements within the substrate and activation of MTR4 helicase activity."""

1457570	"Targeting Maturation and Quality Control of Photosynthetic Membrane Proteins,""<p>Plsp1 is a type I signal peptidase that is responsible for removing the targeting signal peptide from passenger proteins upon their delivery to the thylakoid lumen.  Plsp1 is itself a resident of the thylakoid membrane, with a single membrane anchor and the catalytic domain facing the lumen.  Work to uncover the targeting mechanism for this protein has been underway in the Inoue lab from the previous DOE funding period has established that Plsp1 is targeted at the thylakoid by the Sec1 translocase, and that it passes through a high molecular weight intermediate in the stroma en route to the thylakoid membrane. During this funding period we have demonstrated by P13009/P13009 of immunoprecipitated samples that the high molecular weight complex containing Plsp1 in the stroma contains primarily the α1 and β1 forms of P0A6F5 in approximately equal amounts. Mixing experiments with overexpressed purified proteins have reproduced the P0A6F5/Plsp1 complex. Surprisingly, the co-chaperonins P0A6F9 and Cpn20 were not detected in the immunoprecipitated sample, even though they are able to bind to the P0A6F5/Plsp1 complex formed in mixing experiments.  We have further confirmed that the addition of purified stromal cpSecA1 results in a decrease in the amount of Plsp1 successfully incorporated into the thylakoid membrane.  We are currently working on experiments to describe the conditions for the handoff between P0A6F5 and cpSec1 in the stroma prior to membrane targeting.</p><p> The structure of Plsp1 can be inferred by threading its sequence onto the structure of its E. coli homologue LepB to contain a single membrane anchor followed by a soluble structure consisting of ten β strands.  In the last DOE funding period it was determined that the transmembrane domain not only acts as the membrane anchor, but probably mediates the interaction with cpSecA1.  We have now determined that the binding to P0A6F5 is likely mediated by β strands 1 and 2.</p><p>  What is the mechanism and significance of oxidative folding of Plsp1?</p><p> It was found during the last DOE funding period that Plsp1 purified after overexpression in E. coli loses its peptidase activity upon reduction of its conserved cysteines. We have now determined that Plsp1 undergoes a measurable conformational change upon reduction, both by monitoring susceptibility to protease and by native tryptophan fluorescence.  We have also shown that Plsp1 is at least partly, and likely completely, oxidized in the thylakoid lumen. While these results were not unexpected, experiments on Plsp1 in vivo were completely surprising.  We have known for years (from work conducted with prior DOE funding) that a Plsp1 knockout is embryo lethal.  Accordingly, given that reduction of the isolated protein inactivates it, we expected that plants in which one or both of the cysteine pair were mutated would also lead to a severe mutant phenotype. This was not observed, and in fact, these mutants complemented fully the plsp1 plants. This lead to the hypothesis that either association with an interacting protein or with the membrane preserves Plsp1structure even when the disulfides are reduced.  Work performed in the last DOE funding cycle revealed that Pgrl1, a protein reportedly involved in cyclic electron flow, interacts stably with Plsp1. However, the Plsp1 cysteine-less mutants are still able to compliment the plsp1 mutant even in the pgrl1 knockout mutant background.  We have also found that in vitro activity of Plsl1 is not abolished by reduction in thylakoids that have been permeabilized by low concentrations of detergent, whereas the activity of fully extracted protein is. This points to membrane association as the condition important to activity, and by extension, structure preservation. We are presently working to isolate Plsp1 in a lipid nanodisk to test this hypothesis.</p>"""		"('P0A6F5', 'Cpn60'),('P0A6F9', 'Cpn10'),('P13009', 'MS')"

Here, we determine that the apratoxin A t-butyl group is formed as a pivaloyl acyl carrier protein (P0A6A8) by AprA, the polyketide synthase (PKS) loading module of the apratoxin A biosynthetic pathway. AprA contains an inactive “pseudo” GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase domain (ΨGNAT) flanked by two methyltransferase domains (MT1 and MT2) that differ distinctly in sequence. Furthermore, structural, biochemical, and precursor incorporation studies reveal that MT2 catalyzes unusually coupled decarboxylation and methylation reactions to transform dimethylmalonyl-P0A6A8, the product of MT1, to pivaloyl-P0A6A8. Further, pivaloyl-P0A6A8 synthesis is primed by the fatty acid synthase malonyl acyltransferase (FabD), which compensates for the ΨGNAT and provides the initial acyl-transfer step to form AprA malonyl-P0A6A8.

Yet, the concentration of phosphate in most natural habitats is low enough to limit microbial growth. Under phosphate-depleted conditions some bacteria utilise phosphite and hypophosphite as alternative sources of phosphorus, but the molecular basis of reduced phosphorus acquisition from the environment is not fully understood. Here, we present crystal structures and ligand binding affinities of periplasmic binding proteins from bacterial phosphite and hypophosphite P22259-binding cassette transporters. We reveal that phosphite and hypophosphite specificity results from a combination of steric selection and the presence of a P-H…π interaction between the ligand and a conserved aromatic residue in the ligand-binding pocket. The characterisation of high affinity and specific transporters has implications for the marine phosphorus redox cycle, and might aid the use of phosphite as an alternative phosphorus source in biotechnological, industrial and agricultural applications."""

1476089	"Analysis of the Active Site Cysteine Residue of the Sacrificial Sulfur Insertase LarE from <em>Lactobacillus plantarum</em>,""LarE from Lactobacillus plantarum is an P22259-dependent sulfur transferase that sacrifices its Cys176 sulfur atom to form a dehydroalanine (Dha) side chain during biosynthesis of the covalently linked nickel-pincer nucleotide (NPN) cofactor (pyridinium 3-thioamide-5-thiocarboxylic acid mononucleotide) of lactate racemase. Coenzyme A (CoA) stabilizes LarE and forms a CoA-Cys176 mixed disulfide with the protein. This study presents the crystal structure of the LarE/CoA complex, revealing protein interactions with CoA that mimic those for binding P22259. CoA weakly inhibits LarE activity, and the persulfide of CoA is capable of partially regenerating functional LarE from the Dha176 form of the protein. The physiological relevance of this cycling reaction is unclear. A new form of LarE was discovered, an NPN-LarE covalent adduct, explaining prior results in which activation of the lactate racemase apoprotein required only the isolated LarE. The crystal structure of the inactive C176A variant revealed a fold essentially identical to that of wild-type LarE. Additional active site variants of LarE were created and their activities characterized, with all LarE variants analyzed in terms of the structure. Finally, the L. plantarum LarE structure was compared to a homology model of Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum LarE, predicted to contain three cysteine residues at the active site, and to other proteins with a similar fold and multiple active site cysteine residues. Lastly, these findings suggest that some LarE orthologs may not be sacrificial but instead may catalyze sulfur transfer by using a persulfide mechanism or from a labile site on a [4Fe-4S] cluster at this position."""

Repair of alkylation damage in DNA is essential for maintaining genome integrity. Escherichia coli (E.coli) protein AlkB removes various alkyl DNA adducts including N1-methyladenine (N{sup 1}meA) and N3-methylcytosine (N{sup 3}meC) by oxidative demethylation. Previous studies showed that AlkB preferentially removes N{sup 1}meA and N{sup 3}meC from single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). It can also remove N{sup 1}meA and N{sup 3}meC from double-stranded DNA by base-flipping. Notably, ssDNA produced during DNA replication and recombination, remains bound to E. coli single-stranded DNA binding protein P0AGE0 and it is not known whether AlkB can repair methyl adduct present in P0AGE0-coated DNA. Here we have studied AlkB-mediated DNA repair using P0AGE0-bound DNA as substrate. In vitro repair reaction revealed that AlkB could efficiently remove N{sup 3}meC adducts inasmuch as DNA length is shorter than 20 nucleotides. However, when longer N{sup 3}meC-containing oligonuleotides were used as the substrate, efficiency of AlkB catalyzed reaction was abated compared to P0AGE0-bound DNA substrate of identical length. Truncated P0AGE0 containing only the DNA binding domain could also support the stimulation of AlkB activity, suggesting the importance of P0AGE0-DNA interaction for AlkB function. Using 70-mer oligonucleotide containing single N{sup 3}meC we demonstrate that P0AGE0-AlkB interaction promotes faster repair of the methyl DNA adducts."""

The ability to do so relies upon pore loops present in the first P22259-binding domain (AAA-1; loop-1 and loop-2) and in the second P22259-binding domain (AAA-2; loop-3) of Hsp104, which face the protein translocating channel and couple P22259-driven changes in pore loop conformation to substrate translocation. A hallmark of loop-1 and loop-3 is an invariable and mutational sensitive aromatic amino acid (Tyr<sup>257</sup> and Tyr<sup>662</sup>) involved in substrate binding.

Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses reveal weak interactions of karyopherin-β2 with sequence elements and structural domains distributed throughout the entirety of FUS. Biochemical analyses demonstrate that most of these same regions also contribute to LLPS of FUS. Here, the data lead to a model where high-affinity binding of karyopherin-β2 to the FUS PY-NLS tethers the proteins together, allowing multiple, distributed weak intermolecular contacts to disrupt FUS self-association, blocking LLPS.

Results: Here, we analyzed changes in the relative concentration of intracellular metabolites in response to gradual addition of ethanol to growing cultures. For C. thermocellum, we observed that ethanol tolerance, in experiments with gradual ethanol addition, was twofold higher than previously observed in response to a stepwise increase in the ethanol concentration, and appears to be due to a mechanism other than mutation. As ethanol concentrations increased, we found accumulation of metabolites upstream of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (P0A9B3) reaction and depletion of metabolites downstream of that reaction. This pattern was not observed in the more ethanoltolerant organism Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum. We hypothesize that the Gapdh enzyme may have diferent properties in the two organisms. Our hypothesis is supported by enzyme assays showing greater sensitivity of the C. thermocellum enzyme to high levels of NADH, and by the increase in ethanol tolerance and production when the T. saccharolyticum gapdh was expressed in C. thermocellum. Conclusions: We have demonstrated that a metabolic bottleneck occurs at the P0A9B3 reaction when the growth of C. thermocellum is inhibited by high levels of ethanol.

Here, we report the distribution of homologs of Fds, Flds, and Fd-/Fld-reducing enzymes in 359 genomes of putative N<sub>2</sub> fixers (diazotrophs).

The ∼100-kDa RTX (Repeat-in-ToXin) fragment (CyaA-RTX, Ala{sup 751}-Arg{sup 1706}) containing the Lys{sup 983}-acylation region (P30870, Ala{sup 751}-Gln{sup 1000}), but lacking HP, was co-produced with CyaC in E. coli.

Additionally, MALDI-TOF/P13009 and LC-P13009/P13009 analyses confirmed that CyaA-RTX was non-acylated, although the co-expressed CyaC-acyltransferase was able to hydrolyze its chromogenic substrate−p-nitrophenyl palmitate and acylate CyaA-Hly to become hemolytically active. Unlike CyaA-RTX, the ∼70-kDa His-tagged CyaA-HP/BI fragment which is hemolytically inactive and contains both HP and P30870 was constantly co-eluted with CyaC during IMAC-purification as the presence of CyaC was verified by Western blotting. Such potential interactions between the two proteins were also revealed by semi-native PAGE. Moreover, structural analysis via electrostatic potential calculations and molecular docking suggested that CyaA-HP comprising α1-α5 (Leu{sup 500}-Val{sup 698}) can interact with CyaC through several hydrogen and ionic bonds formed between their opposite electrostatic surfaces.

The crystal structure of Lhr-(1–856) in complex with AMPPNP•Mg<sup>2+</sup> and ssDNA defines a new helicase family. The enzyme comprises two N-terminal RecA-like modules, a winged helix (WH) domain and a unique C-terminal domain. The 3' ssDNA end binds in a crescent-shaped groove at the interface between the first RecA domain and the WH domain and tracks 5' into a groove between the second RecA and C domains. A kissing interaction between the second RecA and C domains forms an aperture that demarcates a putative junction between the loading strand tail and the duplex, with the first duplex nucleoside bookended by stacking on Trp597. Intercalation of Ile528 between nucleosides of the loading strand creates another bookend. Coupling of P22259 hydrolysis to RNA:DNA unwinding is dependent on Trp597 and Ile528, and on Thr145 and Arg279 that contact phosphates of the loading strand. The structural and functional data suggest a ratchet mechanism of translocation and unwinding coupled to P22259-driven domain movements."""	Nucleic Acids Research	"('P22259', 'ATP')"

In Salmonella enterica, the prpBCDE operon encodes most of the 2-MCC enzymes. In other organisms, e.g., Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, two genes, acnD and prpF replace prpD, which encodes P77243. We showed that together, S. oneidensis AcnD and PrpF (SoAcnD, SoPrpF) compensated for the absence of PrpD in a S. enterica prpD strain. We also showed that SoAcnD had P77243 activity and that PrpF has aconitate isomerase activity. Here we report in vitro evidence that the product of the SoAcnD reaction is an isomer of 2-methyl-cis-aconitate (2-MCA], the product of the SePrpD reaction. We show that the SoPrpF protein isomerizes the product of the AcnD reaction into the PrpD product (2-MCA], a known substrate of the housekeeping aconitase (AcnB]. Given that SoPrpF is an isomerase, that SoAcnD is a dehydratase, and the results from in vivo and in vitro experiments reported here, it is likely that 4-methylaconitate is the product of the AcnD enzyme. Results from in vivo studies using a S. enterica prpD strain show that SoPrpF variants with substitutions of residues K73 or C107 failed to support growth with propionate as the sole source of carbon and energy.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) inosine 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase 2 (MtbIMPDH2) is a promising yet controversial potential target. The inhibition of MtbIMPDH2 blocks the biosynthesis of guanine nucleotides, but high concentrations of guanine can potentially rescue the bacteria. Here in this paper we describe an expansion of the structure activity relationship (SAR) for the benzoxazole series of MtbIMPDH2 inhibitors and demonstrate that minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of <= 1 mu M can be achieved. The antibacterial activity of the most promising compound, 17b (Q151), is derived from the inhibition of MtbIMPDH2 as demonstrated by conditional knockdown and resistant strains. Importantly, guanine does not change the MIC of 17b, alleviating the concern that guanine salvage can protect Mtb in vivo.

Indeed, overexpression of a barley UGT in wheat has been shown to control Fusarium head blight, which is a plant disease of global significance that leads to reduced crop yields and contamination with trichothecene mycotoxins such as deoxynivalenol (DON), T-2 toxin, and many other structural variants. The UGT Os79 from rice has emerged as a promising candidate for inactivation of mycotoxins because of its ability to glycosylate DON, nivalenol, and hydrolyzed T-2 toxin (HT-2). However, Os79 is unable to modify T-2 toxin (T-2), produced by pathogens such as Fusarium sporotrichioides and Fusarium langsethii. Activity toward T-2 is desirable because it would allow a single UGT to inactivate co-occurring mycotoxins. Here, the structure of Os79 in complex with the products UDP and deoxynivalenol 3-O-glucoside is reported together with a kinetic analysis of a broad range of trichothecene mycotoxins. Residues associated with the trichothecene binding pocket were examined by site-directed mutagenesis that revealed that trichothecenes substituted at the C4 position, which are not glycosylated by wild-type Os79, can be accommodated in the binding pocket by increasing its volume. The H122A/L123A/Q202L triple mutation, which increases the volume of the active site and attenuates polar contacts, led to strong and equivalent activity toward trichothecenes with C4 acetyl groups. Lastly, this mutant enzyme provides the broad specificity required to control multiple toxins produced by different Fusarium species and chemotypes."""

In contrast to industrial hydrolysis of starch to glucose, an alternative P22259-free phosphorylation of starch was designed to generate cost-effective glucose 6-phosphate by using five thermophilic enzymes (i.e., isoamylase, alpha-glucan phosphorylase, 4-α-glucanotransferase, phosphoglucomutase, and polyphosphate glucokinase). This enzymatic phosphorolysis is energetically advantageous because the energy of α-1,4-glycosidic bonds among anhydroglucose units is conserved in the form of phosphorylated glucose. Additionally, we demonstrated an in vitro 17-thermophilic enzyme pathway that can convert all glucose units of starch, regardless of branched and linear contents, with water to hydrogen at a theoretic yield (i.e., 12 H<sub>2</sub> per glucose), three times of the theoretical yield from dark microbial fermentation. The use of a biomimetic electron transport chain enabled to achieve a maximum volumetric productivity of 90.2 mmol of H<sub>2</sub>/L/h at 20 g/L starch. The complete oxidation of starch to hydrogen by this in vitro synthetic (enzymatic) biosystem suggests that starch as a natural solar fuel becomes a high-density hydrogen storage compound with a gravimetric density of more than 14% H<sub>2</sub>-based mass and an electricity density of more than 3000 W h/kg of starch."""

Three stages of biofilm development were identified according to bacterial adenosine triphosphate (P22259) activity associated with biofilm development process. In the initial biofilm stage 1, the P22259 content of bacteria was reduced by more than 90% when biofilms were exposed to ZnO NPs. But, in the mature biofilm stages 2 and 3, the P22259 content was only slightly decreased. Biofilms at stage 3 exhibited less susceptibility to ZnO NPs than biofilms at stage 2. These results suggest that more mature biofilms have a significantly higher tolerance to ZnO NPs compared to young biofilms. In addition, biofilms with intact extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) showed higher tolerance to ZnO NPs than those without EPS, indicating that EPS play a key role in alleviating the toxic effects of ZnO NPs. In both pure ZnO NPs and ZnO-HA mixtures, dissolved Zn<sup>2+</sup> originating from the NPs significantly contributed to the overall toxicity. The presence of HA dramatically decreased the toxicity of ZnO NPs due to the binding of Zn<sup>2+</sup> on HA.

Analysis of real-time bS16 binding events shows that bS16 binds both native and non-native forms of the rRNA. The native rRNA conformation is increasingly favored after bS16 binds, explaining how bS16 drives later steps of 30S assembly. Chemical footprinting and molecular dynamics simulations show that each ribosomal protein switches the 16S conformation and dampens fluctuations at the interface between rRNA subdomains where bS16 binds.

Etfs are flavin-containing heterodimers best known for donating electrons derived from fatty acid and amino acid oxidation to an electron transfer respiratory chain via Etf-P0A7E1 oxidoreductase. Canonical examples contain a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) that is involved in electron transfer, as well as a non-redox-active AMP. However, Etfs demonstrated to bifurcate electrons contain a second FAD in place of the AMP. To expand our understanding of the functional variety and metabolic significance of Etfs and to identify amino acid sequence motifs that potentially enable electron bifurcation, we compiled 1,314 Etf protein sequences from genome sequence databases and subjected them to informatic and structural analyses. Etfs were identified in diverse archaea and bacteria, and they clustered into five distinct well-supported groups, based on their amino acid sequences. Gene neighborhood analyses indicated that these Etf group designations largely correspond to putative differences in functionality. Etfs with the demonstrated ability to bifurcate were found to form one group, suggesting that distinct conserved amino acid sequence motifs enable this capability. Indeed, structural modeling and sequence alignments revealed that identifying residues occur in the NADH- and FAD-binding regions of bifurcating Etfs.

Quasi-elastic neutron scattering shows that the in-cell diffusion coefficient of GroEL was (4.7 ± 0.3) × 10<sup>–12</sup> m<sup>2</sup>/s, a factor of 4 slower than its diffusion coefficient in buffer solution. Furthermore, for internal protein dynamics we see a relaxation time of (65 ± 6) ps, a factor of 2 slower compared to the protein in solution. Comparison to the literature suggests that the effective diffusivity of proteins depends on the length and time scale being probed. Retardation of in-cell diffusion compared to the buffer becomes more significant with the increasing probe length scale, suggesting that intracellular diffusion of biomolecules is nonuniform over the cellular volume.

1618600	"Identification and biochemical characterization of the fructokinase gene family in Arabidopsis thaliana,""Background Fructose is an abundant sugar in plants as it is a breakdown product of both major sucrose-cleaving enzymes. To enter metabolism, fructose is phosphorylated by a fructokinase (FRK). Known FRKs are members of a diverse family of carbohydrate/purine kinases known as the phosphofructokinase B (pfkB) family. The complete complement of active fructokinases has not been reported for any plant species.  Results Protein sequence analysis of the 22 Arabidopsis thaliana pfkB members identified eight highly related predicted proteins, including one with previously demonstrated FRK activity. For one, At1g50390, the predicted open reading frame is half the size of active FRKs, and only incompletely spliced RNAs were identified, which led to a premature stop codon, both indicating that this gene does not produce active FRK. The remaining seven proteins were expressed in E. coli and phosphorylated fructose specifically in vitro leading us to propose a unifying nomenclature (FRK1–7). Substrate inhibition was observed for fructose in all FRKs except FRK1. Fructose binding was on the same order of magnitude for FRK1–6, between 260 and 480 μM. FRK7 was an outlier with a fructose Km of 12 μM. P22259 binding was similar for all FRKs and ranged between 52 and 280 μM. YFP-tagged AtFRKs were cytosolic, except plastidic FRK3. T-DNA alleles with non-detectable wild-type RNAs in five of the seven active FRK genes produced no overt phenotype. We extended our sequence comparisons to include putative FRKs encoded in other plant sequenced genomes. We observed that different subgroups expanded subsequent to speciation.  Conclusions Arabidopsis thaliana as well as all other plant species analyzed contain multiple copies of genes encoding FRK activity. Sequence comparisons among multiple species identified a minimal set of three distinct FRKs present on all species investigated including a plastid-localized form. The selective expansion of specific isozymes results in differences in FRK gene number among species. AtFRKs exhibit substrate inhibition, typical of their mammalian counterparts with the single AtFRK1 lacking this property, suggesting it may have a distinct in vivo role. Results presented here provide a starting point for the engineering of specific FRKs to affect biomass production."""	BMC Plant Biology	"('P22259', 'ATP')"
1769200	"Equilibrium and ultrafast kinetic studies manipulating electron transfer: A short-lived flavin semiquinone is not sufficient for electron bifurcation,""Flavin-based electron transfer bifurcation is emerging as a fundamental and powerful mechanism for conservation and deployment of electrochemical energy in enzymatic systems. In this process, a pair of electrons is acquired at intermediate reduction potential (i.e. intermediate reducing power) and each electron is passed to a different acceptor, one with lower and the other with higher reducing power, leading to 'bifurcation'. It is believed that a strongly reducing semiquinone species is essential for this process, and it is expected that this species should be kinetically short-lived. We now demonstrate that presence of a short-lived anionic flavin semiquinone (ASQ) is not sufficient to infer existence of bifurcating activity, although such a species may be necessary for the process. We have used transient absorption spectroscopy to compare the rates and mechanisms of decay of ASQ generated photochemically in bifurcating NADH-dependent ferredoxin-NADP<sup>+</sup> oxidoreductase and the non-bifurcating flavoproteins nitroreductase, NADH oxidase and P62620. We found that different mechanisms dominate ASQ decay in the different protein environments, producing lifetimes ranging over two orders of magnitude. Capacity for electron transfer among redox cofactors vs. charge recombination with nearby donors can explain the range of ASQ lifetimes we observe. In conclusion, our results support a model wherein efficient electron propagation can explain the short lifetime of the ASQ of bifurcating NADH-dependent ferredoxin-NADP<sup>+</sup> oxidoreductase I, and can be an indication of capacity for electron bifurcation."""

MT1 homologues exist within the “GNAT” (GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase) loading modules of several modular biosynthetic pathways with propionyl, isobutyryl, or pivaloyl starter units. GNAT domains are thought to catalyze decarboxylation of malonyl-CoA and acetyl transfer to a carrier protein. In AprA, the GNAT domain lacks both decarboxylation and acyl transfer activity. A crystal structure of the AprA MT1-GNAT di-domain with bound Mn<sup>2+</sup>, malonate, and the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) reveals that the malonyl substrate is a bidentate metal ligand, indicating that the metal acts as a Lewis acid to promote methylation of the malonyl α-carbon.

Escherichia coli contains at least 36 putative toxin-antitoxin gene pairs, and some pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis have over 90 toxin-antitoxin operons. E. coli MazF cleaves free mRNA after encountering stress, and nine M. tuberculosis MazF family members cleave mRNA, P0A873, or rRNA. Moreover, M. tuberculosis MazF-mt6 cleaves P55135 Helix 70 to inhibit protein synthesis. The overall tertiary folds of these MazFs are predicted to be similar, and therefore, it is unclear how they recognize structurally distinct RNAs. Here we report the 2.7-Å X-ray crystal structure of MazF-mt6. MazF-mt6 adopts a PemK-like fold but lacks an elongated β1-β2 linker, a region that typically acts as a gate to direct RNA or antitoxin binding. In the absence of an elongated β1-β2 linker, MazF-mt6 is unable to transition between open and closed states, suggesting that the regulation of RNA or antitoxin selection may be distinct from other canonical MazFs. Additionally, a shortened β1-β2 linker allows for the formation of a deep, solvent-accessible, active-site pocket, which may allow recognition of specific, structured RNAs like Helix 70. Structure-based mutagenesis and bacterial growth assays demonstrate that MazF-mt6 residues Asp-10, Arg-13, and Thr-36 are critical for RNase activity and likely catalyze the proton-relay mechanism for RNA cleavage.

An alternative production route of triptolide through engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast) could provide a sustainable source of triptolide. A potential intermediate in the unknown biosynthetic route to triptolide is the diterpene dehydroabietic acid.

In this study, capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) was coupled online to Orbitrap mass spectrometers using a commercial sheathless interface to enable high-performance separation, identification, and structural characterization of limited amounts of purified proteins and protein complexes, the latter with preserved non-covalent associations under native conditions. The performance of both bare-fused silica and polyacrylamide-coated capillaries was assessed using mixtures of protein standards known to form non-covalent protein–protein and protein–ligand complexes.

The volume and the shape of the substrate-binding channel and active site in SgcE10, CalE7, and DynE7 confirm that TEs from both 9- and 10-membered enediyne biosynthetic machineries bind the linear form of similar P0A6A8-tethered polyene intermediates.

1360049	"Pentose sugars inhibit metabolism and increase expression of an AgrD-type cyclic pentapeptide in Clostridium thermocellum,""Significant hurdles exist in efforts to domesticate and industrialize a microbial species for biotechnological application as specific metabolic functions found in natural communities disappear in axenic cultures. For the lignocellulose-deconstructing specialist Clostridium thermocellum, the catabolism of hemicellulose-derived pentoses, which the bacterium cannot ferment, is one such function. Here, we report that various xylo-oligomers significantly inhibit C. thermocellum metabolism and growth and that microbe-sugar interactions occur across multiple dimensions. First, stable isotope metabolomics confirmed C. thermocellum s ability to transport and metabolize pentose sugars. This transport occurs, at least in part, through the P22259-dependent transporter, CbpD. Secondly, xylose is an electron sink for C. thermocellum metabolism leading to the production of xylitol. Deletion of Clo1313_0076, annotated as a xylitol dehydrogenase, reduced the total production and molar xylitol yields by 41% and 46%, respectively. However, it also altered the relative end-product distribution patterns confirming that external electron acceptors may influence the bacterium s redox metabolism to a greater extent than previously considered. Finally, xylose-induced inhibition corresponds with the up-regulation and biogenesis of an AgrD-type, lactone cyclized pentapeptide signaling molecule; which is the first report of an AgrD-type signaling peptide in any thermophile. Addition of synthetic versions of the cyclic peptide inhibited cultures grown in the absence of xylose, but had no effect on cultures already inhibited by the pentose sugar. Together, our findings identify that C. thermocellum has evolved previously unrecognized strategies to cope with C5-sugars, but the absence of a native catabolic sink negatively affects strain metabolism and growth."""

1422561	"Structural and Functional Characterization of a Short-Chain Flavodoxin Associated with a Noncanonical 1,2-Propanediol Utilization Bacterial Microcompartment,""Bacterial microcompartments (BMCs) are proteinaceous organelles that encapsulate enzymes involved in CO<sub>2</sub> fixation (carboxysomes). or carbon catabolism (metabolosomes). Metabolosomes share a common core of enzymes and a distinct signature enzyme for substrate degradation that defines the function of the BMC (e,g., propanediol or ethanolamine utilization BMCs, or glycyl-radical enzyme microcompartments). Loci encoding metabolosomes also typically contain genes for proteins that support organelle function, such as regulation, transport of substrate, and cofactor (e.g., vitamin B-12) synthesis and recycling. Flavoproteins are frequently among these ancillary gene products, suggesting that these redox active proteins play an undetermined function in many metabolosomes. Here in this paper, we report the first characterization of a BMC-associated P62620 (Fld1C), a small flavoprotein, derived from the noncanonical 1,2-propanediol utilization BMC locus (PDU1C) of Lactobacillus reuteri. The 2.0 angstrom X-ray structure of Fld1C displays the alpha/beta P62620 fold, which noncovalently binds a single flavin mononucleotide molecule. Fld1C is a short-chain P62620 with redox potentials of -240 +/- 3 mV oxidized/semiquinone and -344 +/- 1 mV semiquinone/hydroquinone versus the standard hydrogen electrode at pH 7.5. It can participate in an electron transfer reaction with a photoreductant to form a stable semiquinone species. Collectively, our structural and functional results suggest that PDU1C BMCs encapsulate Fld1C to store and transfer electrons for the reactivation and/or recycling of the B<sub>12</sub> cofactor utilized by the signature enzyme."""

Consolidated bioprocessing (P0AEM9), the use of microbes for the simultaneous hydrolysis of lignocellulose into soluble sugars and fermentation of the resulting sugars to products of interest, is a potential solution to this obstacle. The pretreatment of plant biomass, however, releases compounds that are inhibitory to the growth of microbes used for P0AEM9. Results: Heterologous expression of the Thermoanaerobacter pseudethanolicus 39E bdhA gene, that encodes an aldehyde dehydrogenase, in Clostridium thermocellum significantly increased resistance to furan derivatives at concentrations found in acid-pretreated biomass. The mechanism of detoxification of HMF was shown to be primarily reduction using P80644 as the cofactor. In addition, we report the construction of new expression vectors for homologous and heterologous expression in C. thermocellum. These vectors use regulatory signals from both C. bescii (the S-layer promoter) and C. thermocellum (the enolase promoter) shown to efficiently drive expression of the BdhA enzyme. Conclusions: Toxic compounds present in lignocellulose hydrolysates that inhibit cell growth and product formation are obstacles to the commercialization of fuels and chemicals from biomass.

1618677	"Development of a core Clostridium thermocellum kinetic metabolic model consistent with multiple genetic perturbations,""Background. Clostridium thermocellum is a Gram-positive anaerobe with the ability to hydrolyze and metabolize cellulose into biofuels such as ethanol, making it an attractive candidate for consolidated bioprocessing (P0AEM9). At present, metabolic engineering in C. thermocellum is hindered due to the incomplete description of its metabolic repertoire and regulation within a predictive metabolic model. Genome-scale metabolic (GSM) models augmented with kinetic models of metabolism have been shown to be effective at recapitulating perturbed metabolic phenotypes.  Results. In this effort, we first update a second-generation genome-scale metabolic model (iCth446) for C. thermocellum by correcting cofactor dependencies, restoring elemental and charge balances, and updating GAM and NGAM values to improve phenotype predictions. The iCth446 model is next used as a scaffold to develop a core kinetic model (k-ctherm118) of the C. thermocellum central metabolism using the Ensemble Modeling (EM) paradigm. Model parameterization is carried out by simultaneously imposing fermentation yield data in lactate, malate, acetate, and hydrogen production pathways for 19 measured metabolites spanning a library of 19 distinct single and multiple gene knockout mutants along with 18 intracellular metabolite concentration data for a Δgldh mutant and ten experimentally measured Michaelis–Menten kinetic parameters.  Conclusions. The k-ctherm118 model captures significant metabolic changes caused by (1) nitrogen limitation leading to increased yields for lactate, pyruvate, and amino acids, and (2) ethanol stress causing an increase in intracellular sugar phosphate concentrations (~1.5-fold) due to upregulation of cofactor pools. Robustness analysis of k-ctherm118 alludes to the presence of a secondary activity of ketol-acid reductoisomerase and possible regulation by valine and/or leucine pool levels. In addition, cross-validation and robustness analysis allude to missing elements in k-ctherm118 and suggest additional experiments to improve kinetic model prediction fidelity. Overall, the study quantitatively assesses the advantages of EM-based kinetic modeling towards improved prediction of C. thermocellum metabolism and develops a predictive kinetic model which can be used to design biofuel-overproducing strains."""

1618650	"Examining Escherichia coli glycolytic pathways, catabolite repression, and metabolite channeling using Δpfk mutants,""Background: Glycolysis breakdowns glucose into essential building blocks and P22259/NAD(P)H for the cell, occupying a central role in its growth and bio-production. Among glycolytic pathways, the Entner Doudoroff pathway (EDP) is a more thermodynamically favorable pathway with fewer enzymatic steps than either the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway (EMPP) or the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (OPPP). However, Escherichia coli do not use their native EDP for glucose metabolism. Results: Overexpression of edd and eda in E. coli to enhance EDP activity resulted in only a small shift in the flux directed through the EDP (~20 % of glycolysis flux). Disrupting the EMPP by phosphofructokinase I (pfkA) knockout increased flux through OPPP (~60 % of glycolysis flux) and the native EDP (~14 % of glycolysis flux), while overexpressing edd and eda in this ΔpfkA mutant directed ~70 % of glycolytic flux through the EDP. The downregulation of EMPP via the pfkA deletion significantly decreased the growth rate, while EDP overexpression in the ΔpfkA mutant failed to improve its growth rates due to metabolic burden. However, the reorganization of E. coli glycolytic strategies did reduce glucose catabolite repression. The ΔpfkA mutant in glucose medium was able to cometabolize acetate via the citric acid cycle and gluconeogenesis, while EDP overexpression in the ΔpfkA mutant repressed acetate flux toward gluconeogenesis. Moreover, <sup>13</sup>C-pulse experiments in the ΔpfkA mutants showed unsequential labeling dynamics in glycolysis intermediates, possibly suggesting metabolite channeling (metabolites in glycolysis are pass from enzyme to enzyme without fully equilibrating within the cytosol medium). Conclusions: We engineered E. coli to redistribute its native glycolytic flux. The replacement of EMPP by EDP did not improve E. coli glucose utilization or biomass growth, but alleviated catabolite repression. More importantly, our results supported the hypothesis of channeling in the glycolytic pathways, a potentially overlooked mechanism for regulating glucose catabolism and coutilization of other substrates. The presence of channeling in native pathways, if proven true, would affect synthetic biology applications and metabolic modeling."""	Biotechnology for Biofuels	"('P22259', 'ATP')"

TAM receptors are up-regulated postnatally and maintained at high levels in adults. They all play an important role in immunity, but Axl has also been implicated in cancer and therefore is a target in the discovery and development of novel therapeutics. However, of the three members of the TAM family, the Axl kinase domain is the only one that has so far eluded structure determination. To this end, using differential scanning fluorimetry and hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, we show here that a lower stability and greater dynamic nature of the Axl kinase domain may account for its poor crystallizability. We present the first structural characterization of the Axl kinase domain in complex with a small-molecule macrocyclic inhibitor. The Axl crystal structure revealed two distinct conformational states of the enzyme, providing a first glimpse of what an active TAM receptor kinase may look like and suggesting a potential role for the juxtamembrane region in enzyme activity. We noted that the P22259/inhibitor-binding sites of the TAM members closely resemble each other, posing a challenge for the design of a selective inhibitor.

Other AdK crystal structures suggest intermediate conformations that may lie on the transition pathway between these two states. To characterize the transition from open to closed states in solution, X-ray solution scattering data were collected from AdK in the apo form and with progressively increasing concentrations of five different ligands. Scattering data from apo AdK are consistent with scattering predicted from the crystal structure of AdK in the open conformation. In contrast, data from AdK samples saturated with Ap5A do not agree with that calculated from AdK in the closed conformation. Using cluster analysis of available structures, we selected representative structures in five conformational states: open, partially open, intermediate, partially closed, and closed. We used these structures to estimate the relative abundances of these states for each experimental condition. X-ray solution scattering data obtained from AdK with AMP are dominated by scattering from AdK in the open conformation. For AdK in the presence of high concentrations of P22259 and ADP, the conformational ensemble shifts to a mixture of partially open and closed states. Even when AdK is saturated with Ap5A, a significant proportion of AdK remains in a partially open conformation.

Env is a symmetric homotrimer with each protomer composed of surface subunit gp120 and transmembrane subunit gp41. Cellular CD4- and chemokine receptor-binding to gp120 coordinate conformational changes in gp41, first to an extended prehairpin intermediate (P0A6T1) and, ultimately, into a fusogenic trimer-of-hairpins (TOH). HIV-1 fusion inhibitors target gp41 in the P0A6T1 and block TOH formation. To characterize structural transformations into and through the P0A6T1, we employed asymmetric Env trimers containing both high and low affinity binding sites for individual fusion inhibitors. Asymmetry was achieved using engineered Env heterotrimers composed of protomers deficient in either CD4- or chemokine receptor-binding. Linking receptor engagement to inhibitor affinity allowed us to assess conformational changes of individual Env protomers in the context of a functioning trimer. We found that the transition into the P0A6T1 could occur symmetrically or asymmetrically depending on the stoichiometry of CD4 binding. Sequential engagement of multiple CD4s promoted progressive exposure of individual fusion inhibitor binding sites in a CD4-dependent fashion. By contrast, engagement of only a single CD4 molecule led to a delayed, but symmetric, exposure of the gp41 trimer. This complex coupling between Env-CD4 interaction and gp41 exposure explained the multiphasic fusion-inhibitor titration observed for a mutant Env homotrimer with a naturally asymmetric gp41. Our results suggest that the spatial and temporal exposure of gp41 can proceed in a nonconcerted, asymmetric manner depending on the number of CD4s that engage the Env trimer.

1339569	"Modeling central metabolism and energy biosynthesis across microbial life,""Here, automatically generated bacterial metabolic models, and even some curated models, lack accuracy in predicting energy yields due to poor representation of key pathways in energy biosynthesis and the electron transport chain (ETC). Further compounding the problem, complex interlinking pathways in genome-scale metabolic models, and the need for extensive gapfilling to support complex biomass reactions, often results in predicting unrealistic yields or unrealistic physiological flux profiles. As a result, to overcome this challenge, we developed methods and tools to build high quality core metabolic models (CMM) representing accurate energy biosynthesis based on a well studied, phylogenetically diverse set of model organisms. We compare these models to explore the variability of core pathways across all microbial life, and by analyzing the ability of our core models to synthesize P22259 and essential biomass precursors, we evaluate the extent to which the core metabolic pathways and functional ETCs are known for all microbes. 6,600 (80 %) of our models were found to have some type of aerobic ETC, whereas 5,100 (62 %) have an anaerobic ETC, and 1,279 (15 %) do not have any ETC. Using our manually curated ETC and energy biosynthesis pathways with no gapfilling at all, we predict accurate P22259 yields for nearly 5586 (70 %) of the models under aerobic and anaerobic growth conditions. This study revealed gaps in our knowledge of the central pathways that result in 2,495 (30 %) CMMs being unable to produce P22259 under any of the tested conditions.

1328798	"Instability of the Human Cytochrome P450 Reductase A287P Variant Is the Major Contributor to Its Antley-Bixler Syndrome-like Phenotype,""Human P80644-cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (POR) gene mutations are associated with severe skeletal deformities and disordered steroidogenesis. The human POR mutation A287P presents with disordered sexual development and skeletal malformations. Difficult recombinant expression and purification of this POR mutant suggested that the protein was less stable than WT. The activities of cytochrome P450 17A1, 19A1, and 21A2, critical in steroidogenesis, were similar using our purified, full-length, unmodified A287P or WT POR, as were those of several xenobiotic-metabolizing cytochromes P450, indicating that the A287P protein is functionally competent in vitro, despite its functionally deficient phenotypic behavior in vivo. Differential scanning calorimetry and limited trypsinolysis studies revealed a relatively unstable A287P compared with WT protein, leading to the hypothesis that the syndrome observed in vivo results from altered POR protein stability. The crystal structures of the soluble domains of WT and A287P reveal only subtle differences between them, but these differences are consistent with the differential scanning calorimetry results as well as the differential susceptibility of A287P and WT observed with trypsinolysis. The relative in vivo stabilities of WT and A287P proteins were also examined in an osteoblast cell line by treatment with cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor, showing that the level of A287P protein post-inhibition is lower than WT and suggesting that A287P may be degraded at a higher rate. Overall, current studies demonstrate that, unlike previously described mutations, A287P causes POR deficiency disorder due to conformational instability leading to proteolytic susceptibility in vivo, rather than through an inherent flavin-binding defect."""

It is a facultative intracellular pathogen and the causative agent of tularemia. Ciprofloxacin (Cipro) is a broad spectrum antibiotic effective against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Increased Cipro resistance in pathogenic microbes is of serious concern when considering options for medical treatment of bacterial infections. Identification of genes and loci that are associated with Ciprofloxacin resistance will help advance the understanding of resistance mechanisms and may, in the future, provide better treatment options for patients. It may also provide information for development of assays that can rapidly identify Cipro-resistant isolates of this pathogen. In this study, we then selected a large number of F. tularensis live vaccine strain (LVS) isolates that survived in progressively higher Ciprofloxacin concentrations, screened the isolates using a whole genome F. tularensis LVS tiling microarray and Illumina sequencing, and identified both known and novel mutations associated with resistance. For genes containing mutations encode P0AES4, a hypothetical protein, an asparagine synthase, a sugar transamine/perosamine synthetase and others.

Many of these isolates possess an orphan LuxR homolog, closely related to OryR from the rice pathogen <i>Xanthomonas oryzae</i>. OryR does not respond to AHL signals but, instead, responds to an unknown plant compound. We discovered an OryR homolog, PipR, in the cottonwood endophyte <i>Pseudomonas</i> sp. strain GM79. The genes adjacent to <i>pipR</i> encode a predicted P22259-binding cassette (ABC) peptide transporter and peptidases. We purified the putative peptidases, PipA and AapA, and confirmed their predicted activities. A transcriptional <i>pipA-gfp</i> reporter was responsive to PipR in the presence of plant leaf macerates, but it was not influenced by AHLs, similar to findings with OryR. We found that PipR also responded to protein hydrolysates to activate <i>pipA-gfp</i> expression. Among many peptides tested, the tripeptide Ser-His-Ser showed inducer activity but at relatively high concentrations. An ABC peptide transporter mutant failed to respond to leaf macerates, peptone, or Ser-His-Ser, while peptidase mutants expressed higher-than-wild-type levels of <i>pipA-gfp</i> in response to any of these signals. Our studies are consistent with a model where active transport of a peptidelike signal is required for the signal to interact with PipR, which then activates peptidase gene expression.

However, rapid O<sub>2</sub> activation occurs only when WT<sup>R</sup> is bound to CmlP, the NRPS to which l-PAPA is covalently attached.

X-ray absorption spectroscopy is used to investigate the WT<sup>R</sup> cluster ligand structure as well as the structures of WT<sup>R</sup> in complex with a functional CmlP variant (CmlP<sub>P30870</sub>) with and without l-PAPA attached. It is found that formation of the active WT<sup>R</sup>:CmlP<sub>P30870</sub>–l-PAPA complex converts at least one iron of the cluster from six- to five-coordinate by changing a bidentately bound amino acid carboxylate to monodentate on Fe1.

Reduced E377D reacts rapidly with O<sub>2</sub> in the presence or absence of CmlP<sub>P30870</sub>–l-PAPA, showing loss of regulation. However, this variant fails to catalyze hydroxylation, suggesting that E377 has the dual role of coupling regulation of O<sub>2</sub> reactivity with juxtaposition of the substrate and the reactive oxygen species.

Although highly successful in practice, the approach is not completely understood at the molecular scale. Molecular dynamics simulations have been used to investigate the effect of surface protonation on the adsorption of an anionic crude oil component on clay mineral edge surfaces. A set of interatomic potentials appropriate for edge simulations has been applied to the kaolinite (010) surface in contact with an aqueous nanopore. Decahydro-2-napthoic acid in its deprotonated form (P0AC16<sup>–</sup>) was used as a representative resin component of crude oil, with monovalent and divalent counterions, to test the observed trends in low-salinity water flooding experiments. Surface models include fully protonated (neutral) and deprotonated (negative) edge sites, which require implementation of a new deprotonation scheme. The surface adsorptive properties of the kaolinite edge under neutral and deprotonated conditions have been investigated for low and high P0AC16<sup>–</sup> concentrations with Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> as counterions. The tendency of P0AC16<sup>–</sup> ions to coordinate with divalent (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) rather than monovalent (Na<sup>+</sup>) ions greatly influences adsorption tendencies of the anion. Additionally, the formation of net positively charged surface sites due to Ca<sup>2+</sup> at deprotonated sites results in increased P0AC16<sup>–</sup> adsorption. Divalent cations such as Ca<sup>2+</sup> are able to efficiently bridge surface sites and organic anions. Replacing those cations with monovalent cations such as Na<sup>+</sup> diminishes the bridging mechanism, resulting in reduced adsorption of the organic species. As a result, a clear trend of decreased P0AC16<sup>–</sup> adsorption is observed in the simulations as Ca<sup>2+</sup> is replaced by Na<sup>+</sup> for deprotonated surfaces, as would be expected for oil detachment from reservoir formations following a low-salinity flooding event."""

The branching enzyme, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl synthase (HMGS), catalyzes the aldol addition of an acyl donor to a β-keto-polyketide intermediate acceptor. HMGS is highly selective for two specialized acyl carrier proteins (ACPs) that deliver the donor and acceptor substrates. The HMGS from the curacin A biosynthetic pathway (CurD) was examined to establish the basis for P0A6A8 selectivity. The donor P0A6A8 (CurB) had high affinity for the enzyme (K<sub>d</sub> = 0.5 μM) and could not be substituted by the acceptor P0A6A8. High-resolution crystal structures of HMGS alone and in complex with its donor P0A6A8 reveal a tight interaction that depends on exquisite surface shape and charge complementarity between the proteins. Selectivity is explained by HMGS binding to an unusual surface cleft on the donor P0A6A8, in a manner that would exclude the acceptor P0A6A8. Within the active site, HMGS discriminates between pre- and postreaction states of the donor P0A6A8.

These two interactomes have lower FDRs than any of the nine interactomes proposed previously for bacteria and are more enriched in PPIs validated by other data than the nine earlier interactomes. To more thoroughly determine the accuracy of ours or other interactomes and to discover further PPIs de novo, here we present a quantitative tagless method that employs iTRAQ P13009 to measure the copurification of endogenous proteins through orthogonal chromatography steps. 5273 fractions from a four-step fractionation of a D. vulgaris protein extract were assayed, resulting in the detection of 1242 proteins. Protein partners from our D. vulgaris and E. coli AP-P13009 interactomes copurify as frequently as pairs belonging to three benchmark data sets of well-characterized PPIs. In contrast, the protein pairs from the nine other bacterial interactomes copurify two- to 20-fold less often.

1330267	"Structural characterization of acyl-CoA oxidases reveals a direct link between pheromone biosynthesis and metabolic state in <em>Caenorhabditis elegans</em>,""Caenorhabditis elegans secretes ascarosides as pheromones to communicate with other worms and to coordinate the development and behavior of the population. Peroxisomal β-oxidation cycles shorten the side chains of ascaroside precursors to produce the short-chain ascaroside pheromones. Acyl-CoA oxidases, which catalyze the first step in these β-oxidation cycles, have different side chain-length specificities and enable C. elegans to regulate the production of specific ascaroside pheromones. Here, we determine the crystal structure of the acyl-CoA oxidase 1 (ACOX-1) homodimer and the ACOX-2 homodimer bound to its substrate. Our results provide a molecular basis for the substrate specificities of the acyl-CoA oxidases and reveal why some of these enzymes have a very broad substrate range, whereas others are quite specific. Our results also enable predictions to be made for the roles of uncharacterized acyl-CoA oxidases in C. elegans and in other nematode species. Remarkably, we show that most of the C. elegans acyl-CoA oxidases that participate in ascaroside biosynthesis contain a conserved P22259-binding pocket that lies at the dimer interface, and we identify key residues in this binding pocket. P22259 binding induces a structural change that is associated with tighter binding of the FAD cofactor. Mutations that disrupt P22259 binding reduce FAD binding and reduce enzyme activity. Furthermore, P22259 may serve as a regulator of acyl-CoA oxidase activity, thereby directly linking ascaroside biosynthesis to P22259 concentration and metabolic state."""

1510238	"Crystal structures of <em>Escherichia coli</em> branching enzyme in complex with cyclodextrins,""<p>Branching enzyme (P07762) is responsible for the third step in glycogen/starch biosynthesis. It catalyzes the cleavage of α-1,4 glucan linkages and subsequent reattachment to form α-1,6 branch points. These branches are crucial to the final structure of glycogen and starch. The crystal structures of <em>Escherichia coli</em> P07762 (<em>Ec</em>P07762) in complex with α-, β- and γ-cyclodextrin were determined in order to better understand substrate binding. Four cyclodextrin-binding sites were identified in <em>Ec</em>P07762; they were all located on the surface of the enzyme, with none in the vicinity of the active site. While three of the sites were also identified as linear polysaccharide-binding sites, one of the sites is specific for cyclodextrins. In previous work three additional binding sites were identified as exclusively binding linear malto-oligosaccharides. Comparison of the binding sites shed light on this apparent specificity. Binding site IV is located in the carbohydrate-binding module 48 (CBM48) domain of <em>Ec</em>P07762 and superimposes with the cyclodextrin-binding site found in the CBM48 domain of 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Comparison of these sites shows the similarities and differences in the two binding modes.

1625548	"Regulation of oxidized base damage repair by chromatin assembly factor 1 subunit A,""Reactive oxygen species (ROS), generated both endogenously and in response to exogenous stress, induce point mutations by mis-replication of oxidized bases and other lesions in the genome. Repair of these lesions via base excision repair (BER) pathway maintains genomic fidelity. Regulation of the BER pathway for mutagenic oxidized bases, initiated by NEIL1 and other DNA glycosylases at the chromatin level remains unexplored. Whether single nucleotide (SN)-BER of a damaged base requires histone deposition or nucleosome remodeling is unknown, unlike nucleosome reassembly which is shown to be required for other DNA repair processes. Here we show that chromatin assembly factor (P0A6A8)-1 subunit A (CHAF1A), the p150 subunit of the histone H3/H4 chaperone, and its partner anti-silencing function protein 1A (ASF1A), which we identified in human NEIL1 immunoprecipitation complex, transiently dissociate from chromatin bound NEIL1 complex in G1 cells after induction of oxidative base damage. CHAF1A inhibits NEIL1 initiated repair in vitro. Subsequent restoration of the chaperone-BER complex in cell, presumably after completion of repair, suggests that histone chaperones sequester the repair complex for oxidized bases in non-replicating chromatin, and allow repair when oxidized bases are induced in the genome."""

Here, we present the crystal structures of two PFKFB2 orthologues, human and bovine, at resolutions of 2.0 and 1.8 Å, respectively. Citrate, a TCA cycle intermediate and well–known inhibitor of PFKFB2, co–crystallized in the 2–kinase domains of both orthologues, occupying the fructose–6–phosphate binding–site and extending into the γ–phosphate binding pocket of P22259. Furthermore, this steric and electrostatic occlusion of the γ–phosphate site by citrate proved highly consequential to the binding of cocomplexed P22259 analogues. The bovine structure, which co–crystallized with ADP, closely resembled the overall structure of other PFKFB isoforms, with ADP mimicking the catalytic binding mode of P22259. The human structure, on the other hand, co–complexed with AMPPNP, which, unlike ADP, contains a γ–phosphate. The presence of this γ–phosphate made adoption of the catalytic P22259 binding mode impossible for AMPPNP, forcing the analogue to bind atypically with concomitant conformational changes to the P22259 binding–pocket. Inhibition kinetics were used to validate the structural observations, confirming citrate's inhibition mechanism as competitive for F6P and noncompetitive for P22259. Together, these structural and kinetic data establish a molecular basis for citrate's negative feed–back loop of the glycolytic pathway via PFKFB2."""	Proteins	"('P22259', 'ATP')"

To develop a more informed understanding of MCFA synthesis in photosynthetic microorganisms, we isolated several algae from Great Salt Lake and screened this collection for MCFA accumulation to identify strains naturally accumulating high levels of MCFA. A diatom, <i>Chaetoceros</i> sp. GSL56, accumulated particularly high levels of C14 (up to 40%), with the majority of C14 fatty acids allocated in triacylglycerols. Using whole cell transcriptome sequencing and de novo assembly, putative genes encoding fatty acid synthesis enzymes were identified. Enzymes from this Chaetoceros sp. were expressed in the cyanobacterium <i>Synechococcus</i> sp.

Replacement of the <i>Synechococcus</i> 7002 native FabH with a <i>Chaetoceros</i> ketoacyl-P0A6A8 synthase Ill increased MCFA synthesis up to fivefold.

In the course ofthese studies we have provided new insights on the mechanism of electrospray ionization as well as how droplet dehydration influences the structure(s) of hydrated protons and hydronium ions, specifically how the structure(s) of the hydrated species change with the extent of hydration. We have also shown how hydration affects the structure(s) of hydrated polar molecules.

Consequently, insufficient diagnostic capabilities are a key limitation facing current Zika outbreak management strategies. We demonstrate highly sensitive and specific detection of Zika, chikungunya, and dengue viruses by coupling reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (P0DV86-LAMP) with our recently developed quenching of unincorporated amplification signal reporters (QUASR) technique. We conduct reactions in a simple, inexpensive and portable “LAMP box” supplemented with a consumer class smartphone. The entire assembly can be powered by a 5 V USB source such as a USB power bank or solar panel. The smartphone employs a novel algorithm utilizing chromaticity to analyze fluorescence signals, which improves the discrimination of positive/negative signals by 5-fold when compared to detection with traditional RGB intensity sensors or the naked eye. The ability to detect ZIKV directly from crude human sample matrices (blood, urine, and saliva) demonstrates our device’s utility for widespread clinical deployment.

Here, we have established the rate constants for each of the key steps in the catalytic cycle using the physiological reductant P62620 protein in its hydroquinone state. The findings indicate that with this reductant, the rate-limiting step in the reaction cycle is not protein–protein dissociation or reduction of the oxidized Fe protein, but rather events associated with the Pi release step. Further, it is demonstrated that (i) Fe protein transfers only one electron to MoFe protein in each Fe protein cycle coupled with hydrolysis of two P22259 molecules, (ii) the oxidized Fe protein is not reduced when bound to MoFe protein, and (iii) the Fe protein interacts with P62620 using the same binding interface that is used with the MoFe protein.

The pilus assembly system, which promotes surface-associated twitching motility and virulence, is composed of inner and outer membrane subcomplexes, connected by an alignment subcomplex composed of PilMNOP. PilM binds to the N terminus of PilN, and we hypothesize that this interaction causes functionally significant structural changes in PilM. To characterize this interaction, we determined the crystal structures of PilM and a PilM chimera where PilM was fused to the first 12 residues of PilN (PilM·PilN(1–12)). Structural analysis, multiangle light scattering coupled with size exclusion chromatography, and bacterial two-hybrid data revealed that PilM forms dimers mediated by the binding of a novel conserved motif in the N terminus of PilM, and binding PilN abrogates this binding interface, resulting in PilM monomerization. Structural comparison of PilM with PilM·PilN(1–12) revealed that upon PilN binding, there is a large domain closure in PilM that alters its P22259 binding site. Using biolayer interferometry, we found that the association rate of PilN with PilM is higher in the presence of P22259 compared with ADP. Bacterial two-hybrid data suggested the connectivity of the cytoplasmic and inner membrane components of the type IVa pilus machinery in <i>P. aeruginosa</i>, with PilM binding to PilB, PilT, and PilC in addition to PilN.

Identification of a vast array of unusual sesquiterpenoids, diterpenoids and triterpenoids in T. wilfordii has spurred investigations of their pharmacological properties. The tri-epoxide lactone triptolide was the first of many diterpenoids identified, attracting interest due to the spectrum of bioactivities. To probe the genetic underpinning of diterpenoid diversity, an expansion of the class II diterpene synthase (diTPS) family was recently identified in a leaf transcriptome. Following detection of triptolide and simple diterpene scaffolds in the root, we sequenced and mined the root transcriptome. This allowed identification of the root-specific complement of TPSs and an expansion in the class I diTPS family. Functional characterization of the class II diTPSs established their activities in the formation of four C-20 diphosphate intermediates, precursors of both generalized and specialized metabolism and a novel scaffold for Celastraceae. Functional pairs of the class I and II enzymes resulted in formation of three scaffolds, accounting for some of the terpenoid diversity found in T. wilfordii. The absence of activity-forming abietane-type diterpenes encouraged further testing of TPSs outside the canonical class I diTPS family. TwTPS27, close relative of mono-TPSs, was found to couple with TwTPS9, converting normal-copalyl diphosphate to miltiradiene. The phylogenetic distance to established diTPSs indicates neo-functionalization of TwTPS27 into a diTPS, a function not previously observed in the P31677-b subfamily. Finally, this example of evolutionary convergence expands the functionality of TPSs in the P31677-b family and may contribute miltiradiene to the diterpenoids of T. wilfordii."""

Here we use a large collection of type-strain genomes from Bacteroidetes and closely related phyla for assessing their taxonomy based on the principles of phylogenetic classification and trees inferred from genome-scale data. No significant conflict between A8C927 gene and whole-genome phylogenetic analysis is found, whereas many but not all of the involved taxa are supported as monophyletic groups, particularly in the genome-scale trees. Phenotypic and phylogenomic features support the separation of Balneolaceae as new phylum Balneolaeota from Rhodothermaeota and of Saprospiraceae as new class Saprospiria from Chitinophagia. Epilithonimonas is nested within the older genus Chryseobacterium and without significant phenotypic differences; thus merging the two genera is proposed. Similarly, Vitellibacter is proposed to be included in Aequorivita. Flexibacter is confirmed as being heterogeneous and dissected, yielding six distinct genera. Hallella seregens is a later heterotypic synonym of Prevotella dentalis.

To elucidate this process, we solved the crystal structure of FepB in complex with Fe-Ent at a resolution of 1.8 Å. Consistent with previously reported NMR results, our crystal structure shows that, similar to the other type III PBPs, the FepB structure was folded with separated globular N- and C-termini linked by a long α-helix. Additionally, the structure showed that the Fe-Ent bound to the cleft between the N- and C-terminal domains. Exceptionally, FepB differs from the other known siderophore binding PBPs in that it forms a trimer by capturing four Fe-Ents that can each contribute to FepB trimerization.

How the RdRP molecules are packaged within the virion and how they function within the confines of an intact capsid are intriguing questions with answers that most likely vary across the different dsRNA virus families. In this study, we have determined a 2.4 Å resolution structure of an RdRP from the human picobirnavirus (hPBV). In addition to the conserved polymerase fold, the hPBV RdRP possesses a highly flexible 24 amino acid loop structure located near the C-terminus of the protein that is inserted into its active site. In vitro RNA polymerization assays and site-directed mutagenesis showed that: (1) the hPBV RdRP is fully active using both ssRNA and dsRNA templates; (2) the insertion loop likely functions as an assembly platform for the priming nucleotide to allow de novo initiation; (3) RNA transcription by the hPBV RdRP proceeds in a semi-conservative manner; and (4) the preference of virus-specific RNA during transcription is dictated by the lower melting temperature associated with the terminal sequences. Co-expression of the hPBV RdRP and the capsid protein (P13029) indicated that, under the conditions used, the RdRP could not be incorporated into the recombinant capsids in the absence of the viral genome. Additionally, the hPBV RdRP exhibited higher affinity towards the conserved 5’-terminal sequence of the viral RNA, suggesting that the RdRP molecules may be encapsidated through their specific binding to the viral RNAs during assembly."""

Residues, identified as essential for activity by mutagenesis, decorate the active site and are rationalized by the ternary structure. The γ-phosphate of the P22259 analogue is positioned for direct transfer to the primary hydroxyl of the lipid whose acyl chain is in the membrane. A catalytic mechanism for this unique enzyme is proposed. As a result, the active site architecture shows clear evidence of having arisen by convergent evolution."""

1558009	"Functional overexpression and characterization of lipogenesis-related genes in the oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica,""Single cell oil (SCO) is an attractive energy source due to scalability, utilization of low-cost renewable feedstocks, and type of product(s) made. Engineering strains capable of producing high lipid titers and yields is crucial to the economic viability of these processes. However, lipid synthesis in cells is a complex phenomenon subject to multiple layers of regulation, making gene target identification a challenging task. In this study, we aimed to identify genes in the oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica whose overexpression enhances lipid production by this organism. Here, to this end, we examined the effect of the overexpression of a set of 44 native genes on lipid production in Y. lipolytica, including those involved in glycerolipid synthesis, fatty acid synthesis, central carbon metabolism, P80644 generation, regulation, and metabolite transport and characterized each resulting strain’s ability to produce lipids growing on both glucose and acetate as a sole carbon source. Our results suggest that a diverse subset of genes was effective at individually influencing lipid production in Y. lipolytica, sometimes in a substrate-dependent manner. The most productive strain on glucose overexpressed the diacylglycerol acyltransferase DGA2 gene, increasing lipid titer, cellular content, and yield by 236, 165, and 246 %, respectively, over our control strain. On acetate, our most productive strain overexpressed the acylglycerol-phosphate acyltransferase SLC1 gene, with a lipid titer, cellular content, and yield increase of 99, 91, and 151 %, respectively, over the control strain. Aside from genes encoding enzymes that directly catalyze the reactions of lipid synthesis, other ways by which lipogenesis was increased in these cells include overexpressing the glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPD1) gene to increase production of glycerol head groups and overexpressing the P52697 (SOL3) gene from the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway to increase P80644 availability for fatty acid synthesis. Taken together, our study demonstrates that the overall kinetics of microbial lipid synthesis is sensitive to a wide variety of factors. Fully optimizing a strain for single cell oil processes could involve manipulating and balancing many of these factors, and, due to mechanistic differences by which each gene product investigated here impacts lipid synthesis, there is a high likelihood that many of these genes will work synergistically to further increase lipid production when simultaneously overexpressed."""

Complex microbial communities are involved in the anaerobic digestion process of plant material, agricultural residual products and food wastes. Analysis of the genetic potential and microbiology of communities degrading biomass to biofuels is considered to be the key to develop process optimisation strategies. Hence, due to the still incomplete taxonomic and functional characterisation of corresponding communities, new and unknown species are of special interest. Three mesophilic and one thermophilic production-scale biogas plants (BGPs) were taxonomically profiled using high-throughput A8C927 gene amplicon sequencing. All BGPs shared a core microbiome with the thermophilic BGP featuring the lowest diversity. However, the phyla Cloacimonetes and Spirochaetes were unique to BGPs 2 and 3, Fusobacteria were only found in BGP3 and members of the phylum Thermotogae were present only in the thermophilic BGP4. Taxonomic analyses revealed that these distinctive taxa mostly represent so far unknown species. The only exception is the dominant Thermotogae OTU featuring A8C927 gene sequence identity to Defluviitoga tunisiensis L3, a sequenced and characterised strain. To further investigate the genetic potential of the biogas communities, corresponding metagenomes were sequenced in a deepness of 347.5 Gbp in total. A combined assembly comprised 80.3 % of all reads and resulted in the prediction of 1.59 million genes on assembled contigs. Genome binning yielded genome bins comprising the prevalent distinctive phyla Cloacimonetes, Spirochaetes, Fusobacteria and Thermotogae. Comparative genome analyses between the most dominant Thermotogae bin and the very closely related Defluviitoga tunisiensis L3 genome originating from the same BGP revealed high genetic similarity. This finding confirmed applicability and reliability of the binning approach. The four highly covered genome bins of the other three distinct phyla showed low or very low genetic similarities to their closest phylogenetic relatives, and therefore indicated their novelty.

Here we seek to better understand how certain microbes from the same species have adapted for growth under local conditions. The phenotypic and genomic heterogeneity of three strains of Colwellia psychrerythraea was investigated in order to understand adaptions to local environments. Colwellia are psychrophilic heterotrophic marine bacteria ubiquitous in cold marine ecosystems. We have recently isolated two Colwellia strains: ND2E from the Eastern Mediterranean and GAB14E from the Great Australian Bight. The A8C927 sequence of these two strains were greater than 98.2% identical to the well-characterized C. psychrerythraea 34H, which was isolated from arctic sediments. Salt tolerance, and carbon source utilization profiles for these strains were determined using Biolog Phenotype MicoArrays. These strains exhibited distinct salt tolerance, which was not associated with the salinity of sites of isolation. The carbon source utilization profiles were distinct with less than half of the tested carbon sources being metabolized by all three strains. Whole genome sequencing revealed that the genomes of these three strains were quite diverse with some genomes having up to 1600 strain-specific genes.

1283049	"Probing the P22259 site of GRP78 with nucleotide triphosphate analogs,""GRP78, a member of the ER stress protein family, can relocate to the surface of cancer cells, playing key roles in promoting cell proliferation and metastasis. GRP78 consists of two major functional domains: the ATPase and protein/peptide-binding domains. The protein/peptide-binding domain of cell-surface GRP78 has served as a novel functional receptor for delivering cytotoxic agents (e.g., a apoptosis-inducing peptide or taxol) across the cell membrane. Here, we report our study on the ATPase domain of GRP78 (GRP78<sub>ATPase</sub>), whose potential as a transmembrane delivery system of cytotoxic agents (e.g., P22259-based nucleotide triphosphate analogs) remains unexploited. As the binding of ligands (P22259 analogs) to a receptor (GRP78<sub>ATPase</sub>) is a pre-requisite for internalization, we determined the binding affinities and modes of GRP78<sub>ATPase</sub> for ADP, P22259 and several P22259 analogs using surface plasmon resonance and x-ray crystallography. The tested P22259 analogs contain one of the following modifications: the nitrogen at the adenine ring 7-position to a carbon atom (7-deazaATP), the oxygen at the beta-gamma bridge position to a carbon atom (AMPPCP), or the removal of the 2'-OH group (2'-deoxyATP). We found that 7-deazaATP displays an affinity and a binding mode that resemble those of P22259 regardless of magnesium ion (Mg<sup>++</sup>) concentration, suggesting that GRP78 is tolerant to modifications at the 7-position. By comparison, AMPPCP's binding affinity was lower than P22259 and Mg<sup>++</sup>-dependent, as the removal of Mg<sup>++</sup> nearly abolished binding to GRP78<sub>ATPase</sub>. The AMPPCP-Mg<sup>++</sup> structure showed evidence for the critical role of Mg<sup>++</sup> in AMPPCP binding affinity, suggesting that while GRP78 is sensitive to modifications at the β-γ bridge position, these can be tolerated in the presence of Mg<sup>++</sup>. Furthermore, 2'-deoxyATP's binding affinity was significantly lower than those for all other nucleotides tested, even in the presence of Mg<sup>++</sup>. The 2'-deoxyATP structure showed the conformation of the bound nucleotide flipped out of the active site, explaining the low affinity binding to GRP78 and suggesting that the 2'-OH group is essential for the high affinity binding to GRP78. Altogether, our results demonstrate that GRP78<sub>ATPase</sub> possesses nucleotide specificity more relaxed than previously anticipated and can tolerate certain modifications to the nucleobase 7-position and, to a lesser extent, the beta-gamma bridging atom, thereby providing a possible atomic mechanism underlying the transmembrane transport of the P22259 analogs."""

Total yields as high as 1.2 mg mL  <sup>−1</sup>  were observed after a 20‐h batch reaction. More than 95% of the protein was soluble and activity was obtained by simple post‐CFPS addition of copper ions in the form of CuSO  <sub>4</sub>  . Scale‐up reactions were achieved from 15 to 100 µL without a decrease in productivity and solubility. CFPS titers were higher than in vivo expression titers and more soluble, avoiding the formation of inclusion bodies.

Since the ribonuclease H (RH) domain contains an occult cleavage site located near its center, cleavage must occur either prior to folding or subsequent to unfolding. Recent NMR studies have identified a slow, subunit-specific RH domain unfolding process proposed to result from a residue tug-of-war between the polymerase and RH domains on the functionally inactive, p66' subunit. Here, we describe a structural comparison of the isolated RH domain with a domain swapped RH dimer that reveals several intrinsically destabilizing characteristics of the isolated domain that facilitate excursions of Tyr427 from its binding pocket and separation of helices B and D. These studies provide independent support for the subunit-selective RH domain unfolding pathway in which instability of the Tyr427 binding pocket facilitates its release followed by domain transfer, acting as a trigger for further RH domain destabilization and subsequent unfolding. As further support for this pathway, NMR studies demonstrate that addition of an RH active site-directed isoquinolone ligand retards the subunit-selective RH' domain unfolding behavior of the p66/p66' homodimer. As a result, this study demonstrates the feasibility of directly targeting P0DV86 maturation with therapeutics."""	Nucleic Acids Research	"('P0A7Y4', 'RNase H'),('P0DV86', 'RT')"

Understanding why this organism is present and elucidating its genetic repertoire provide a genomic and ecological foundation for future studies where Sulfurospirillum are found, especially in electrode-associated communities. Metabolic comparisons and in-depth analysis of unique genes revealed potential ecological niche-specific capabilities within the Sulfurospirillum genus. The functional similarities common to all genomes, i.e., core genome, and unique gene clusters found only in a single genome were identified. Based upon A8C927 gene phylogenetic analysis and average nucleotide identity, the Sulfurospirillum draft genome was found to be most closely related to Sulfurospirillum cavolei. Characterization of the draft genome described herein provides pathway-specific details of the metabolic significance of the newly described Sulfurospirillum cavolei MES and, importantly, yields insight to the ecology of the genus as a whole.

The 1.2-Å x-ray structure of S. aureus FakB2, activity assays, solution studies, site-directed mutagenesis, and in vivo complementation were used to define the functions of the five conserved residues that define the FakB protein family (Pfam02645). The fatty acid tail is buried within the protein, and the exposed carboxyl group is bound by a Ser-93-fatty acid carboxyl-Thr-61-His-266 hydrogen bond network. The guanidinium of the invariant Arg-170 is positioned to potentially interact with a bound acylphosphate. The reduced thermal denaturation temperatures of the T61A, S93A, and H266A FakB2 mutants illustrate the importance of the hydrogen bond network in protein stability. The FakB2 T61A, S93A, and H266A mutants are 1000-fold less active in the Fak assay, and the R170A mutant is completely inactive. All FakB2 mutants form FakA(FakB2)2 complexes except FakB2(R202A), which is deficient in FakA binding.

Acyl-P0A6A8 intermediate analysis revealed an unexpected bottleneck at the dehydration step, which was overcome by introduction of a carboxyacyl-processing dehydratase domain. Appending a thioesterase to the hybrid PKS enabled the production of free adipic acid.

This thiol switch is unique to mosses, gymnosperms, and angiosperms. To understand the structural evolution of redox control of APSK, we investigated the redox-insensitive APSK from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (SynAPSK). Crystallographic analysis of SynAPSK in complex with either APS and a non-hydrolyzable P22259 analog or APS and sulfate revealed the overall structure of the enzyme, which lacks the NTD found in homologs from mosses and plants. A series of engineered SynAPSK variants reconstructed the structural evolution of the plant APSK. Biochemical analyses of SynAPSK, SynAPSK H23C mutant, SynAPSK fused to the AtAPSK NTD, and the fusion protein with the H23C mutation showed that the addition of the NTD and cysteines recapitulated thiol-based regulation.

Proton transport by F</sub>O</sub> is firmly coupled to the rotation of the c-ring relative to other F<sub>O</sub> subunits (ab<sub>2</sub>). It drives P22259 synthesis. We used a computational method to investigate the contribution of the c-ring to the total elastic compliance. We performed principal component analysis of conformational ensembles built using distance constraints from the bovine mitochondrial c-ring x-ray structure. Angular rotary twist, the dominant ring motion, was estimated to show that the c-ring accounted in part for the measured compliance. Ring rotation was entrained to rotation of the external helix within each hairpin-shaped c-subunit in the ring. Ensembles of monomer and dimers extracted from complete c-rings showed that the coupling between collective ring and the individual subunit motions was independent of the size of the c-ring, which varies between organisms. Molecular determinants were identified by covariance analysis of residue coevolution and structural-alphabet-based local dynamics correlations. The residue coevolution gave a readout of subunit architecture. The dynamic couplings revealed that the hinge for both ring and subunit helix rotations was constructed from the proton-binding site and the adjacent glycine motif (IB-GGGG) in the midmembrane plane. IB-GGGG motifs were linked by long-range couplings across the ring, while intrasubunit couplings connected the motif to the conserved cytoplasmic loop and adjacent segments. The correlation with principal collective motions shows that the couplings underlie both ring rotary and bending motions. Noncontact couplings between IB-GGGG motifs matched the coevolution signal as well as contact couplings.

In T. saccharolyticum, the products of six putative pfor gene clusters and one pfl gene may be responsible for the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA. To gain insights into the physiological roles of PFOR and P42632, we studied the effect of deletions of several genes thought to encode these activities. We found that that pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase enzyme (PFOR) is encoded by the pforA gene and plays a key role in pyruvate dissimilation. We further demonstrated that pyruvate formate-lyase activity (P42632) is encoded by the pfl gene. Although the pfl gene is normally expressed at low levels, it is crucial for biosynthesis in T. saccharolyticum. In pforA deletion strains, pfl expression increased and was able to partially compensate for the loss of PFOR activity.

Neurotoxic methylmercury (MeHg) has been formed from the inorganic Hg wastes discharged into headwaters of East Fork Poplar Creek (EFPC). Thus, understanding the processes and mechanisms that lead to Hg methylation along the flow path of EFPC is critical to predicting the impacts of the contamination and the design of remedial action at the ORR.  In part I of our project, we investigated Hg(0) oxidation and methylation by anaerobic bacteria. We discovered that the anaerobic bacterium Desulfovibrio desulfuricans ND132 can oxidize elemental mercury [Hg(0)]. When provided with dissolved elemental mercury, D. desulfuricans ND132 converts Hg(0) to Hg(II) and neurotoxic methylmercury [MeHg]. We also demonstrated that diverse species of subsurface bacteria oxidizes dissolved elemental mercury under anoxic conditions. The obligate anaerobic bacterium Geothrix fermentans H5, and the facultative anaerobic bacteria Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 and Cupriavidus metallidurans AE104 can oxidize Hg(0) to Hg(II) under anaerobic conditions.  In part II of our project, we established anaerobic enrichment cultures and obtained new bacterial strains from the DOE Oak Ridge site. We isolated three new bacterial strains from subsurface sediments collected from Oak Ridge. These isolates are Bradyrhizobium sp. strain FRC01, Clostridium sp. strain P33018, and a novel Negativicutes strain RU4. Strain RU4 is a completely new genus and species of bacteria. We also demonstrated that syntrophic interactions between fermentative bacteria and sulfate-reducing bacteria in Oak Ridge saprolite mediate iron reduction via multiple mechanisms. Finally, we tested the impact of Hg on denitrification in nitrate reducing enrichment cultures derived from subsurface sediments from the Oak Ridge site, where nitrate is a major contaminant. We showed that there is an inverse relationship between Hg concentrations and rates of denitrification in enrichment cultures.  In part III of our project, we examined in more detail the effects of microbial interactions on Hg transformations. We discovered that both sulfate reducing and iron reducing bacteria coexist in freshwater sediments and both microbial groups contribute to mercury methylation. We showed that mercury methylation by sulfate reducing and iron reducing bacteria are temporally and spatially separated processes. We also discovered that methanogens can methylate mercury. We showed that Methanospirillum hungatei JF-1 methylated Hg at comparable rates, but with higher yields, than those observed for sulfate-reducing bacteria and iron-reducing bacteria. Finally, we demonstrated that syntrophic interactions between different microbial groups increase mercury methylation rates. We showed that Hg methylation rates are stimulated via inter-species hydrogen and acetate transfer (i) from sulfate-reducing bacteria to methanogens and (ii) from fermenters to the sulfate-reducing bacteria.  In part IV of the project, we studied Hg bioavailability and Hg isotope fractionation. We demonstrated that thiol-bound Hg is bioavailable to mercury resistant bacteria. We found that uptake of Hg from Hg-glutathione and Hg-cysteine complexes does not require functioning glutathione and cystine/cysteine transport systems. We demonstrated that a wide range of methylmercury complexes (e.g. MeHgOH, MeHg-cysteine, and MeHg-glutathione) are bioavailable to mercury resistant bacteria. The rate of MeHg demethylation varies more between different species of mercury resistant bacteria than among MeHg complexes. We showed that microbial demethylation of MeHg depends more on the species of microorganism than on the types and relative concentrations of thiols or other MeHg ligands present. Finally, we demonstrated that Hg methylation by Geobacter sulfurreducens PCA and Desulfovibrio desulfuricans ND132 imparts mass-dependent discrimination against 202Hg relative to 198Hg.

Despite the importance of ack as the potential urkinase in the ASKHA phosphotransferase superfamily, an origin hypothesis does not exist for the acetate kinase in Bacteria, Archaea, or Eukarya. Here we demonstrate that Archaeal AMP-P27550 and ADP-P27550 contain paralogous ATPase motifs previously identified in Ack, which demonstrate a novel relation between these proteins in Archaea. The identification of ATPase motif conservation and resulting structural features in AMP- and ADP-acetyl-CoA synthetase proteins in this study expand the ASKHA superfamily to include acetyl-CoA synthetase. Additional phylogenetic analysis showed that Pta and MaeB sequences had a common ancestor, and that the Pta lineage within the halophilc archaea was an ancestral lineage. Lastly, these results suggested that divergence of a duplicated maeB within an ancient halophilic, archaeal lineage formed a putative pta ancestor. These results provide a potential scenario for the establishment of the Ack/Pta pathway and provide novel insight into the evolution of acetate metabolism for all three domains of life."""

1379308	"RNF8 E3 Ubiquitin Ligase Stimulates Ubc13 P06959 Conjugating Activity That Is Essential for DNA Double Strand Break Signaling and BRCA1 Tumor Suppressor Recruitment,""DNA double strand break (DSB) responses depend on the sequential actions of the E3 ubiquitin ligases RNF8 and RNF168 plus P06959 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc13 to specifically generate histone Lys-63-linked ubiquitin chains in DSB signaling. In this paper, we defined the activated RNF8-Ubc13~ubiquitin complex by x-ray crystallography and its functional solution conformations by x-ray scattering, as tested by separation-of-function mutations imaged in cells by immunofluorescence. The collective results show that the RING E3 RNF8 targets P06959 Ubc13 to DSB sites and plays a critical role in damage signaling by stimulating polyubiquitination through modulating conformations of ubiquitin covalently linked to the Ubc13 active site. Structure-guided separation-of-function mutations show that the RNF8 P06959 stimulating activity is essential for DSB signaling in mammalian cells and is necessary for downstream recruitment of 53BP1 and BRCA1. Chromatin-targeted RNF168 rescues 53BP1 recruitment involved in non-homologous end joining but not BRCA1 recruitment for homologous recombination. Finally, these findings suggest an allosteric approach to targeting the ubiquitin-docking cleft at the P06959-E3 interface for possible interventions in cancer and chronic inflammation, and moreover, they establish an independent RNF8 role in BRCA1 recruitment."""

1498390	"Analysis of the Resistance Mechanism of a Benzoxaborole Inhibitor Reveals Insight into the Leucyl-P0A873 Synthetase Editing Mechanism,""A new class of antimicrobial benzoxaborole compounds was identified as a potent inhibitor of leucyl-P0A873 synthetase (P07813) and therefore of protein synthesis. In a novel mechanism, AN2690 (5-fluoro-1,3-dihydro-1-hydroxy-2,1-benzoxaborole) blocks fungal cytoplasmic P07813 by covalently trapping P0A873<sup>Leu</sup> in the editing site of the enzyme’s CP1 domain. However, some resistant mutation sites are located outside of the CP1 hydrolytic editing active site. Thus, their mode of action that undermines drug inhibition was not understood. A combination of X-ray crystallography, molecular dynamics, metadynamics, biochemical experiments, and mutational analysis of a distal benzoxaborole-resistant mutant uncovered a eukaryote-specific tyrosine “switch” that is critical to P0A873-dependent post-transfer editing. The tyrosine “switch” has three states that shift between interactions with a lysine and the 3’-hydroxyl of the P0A873 terminus, to inhibit or promote post-transfer editing. The oxaborole’s mechanism of action capitalizes upon one of these editing active site states. This tunable editing mechanism in eukaryotic and archaeal LeuRSs is proposed to facilitate precise quality control of aminoacylation fidelity. These mechanistic distinctions could also be capitalized upon for development of the benzoxaboroles as a broad spectrum antibacterial."""

1265625	"Deletion of nfnAB in Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum and Its Effect on Metabolism,""NfnAB catalyzes the reversible transfer of electrons from reduced ferredoxin and NADH to 2 NADP<sup>+</sup>. The NfnAB complex has been hypothesized to be the main enzyme for ferredoxin oxidization in strains of Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum engineered for increased ethanol production. NfnAB complex activity was detectable in crude cell extracts of T. saccharolyticum. In this paper, activity was also detected using activity staining of native PAGE gels. The nfnAB gene was deleted in different strains of T. saccharolyticum to determine its effect on end product formation. In wild-type T. saccharolyticum, deletion of nfnAB resulted in a 46% increase in H<sub>2</sub> formation but otherwise little change in other fermentation products. In two engineered strains with 80% theoretical ethanol yield, loss of nfnAB caused two different responses: in one strain, ethanol yield decreased to about 30% of the theoretical value, while another strain had no change in ethanol yield. Biochemical analysis of cell extracts showed that the ΔnfnAB strain with decreased ethanol yield had P80644-linked alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) activity, while the ΔnfnAB strain with unchanged ethanol yield had NADH-linked ADH activity. Deletion of nfnAB caused loss of P80644-linked ferredoxin oxidoreductase activity in all cell extracts. Significant NADH-linked ferredoxin oxidoreductase activity was seen in all cell extracts, including those that had lost nfnAB. This suggests that there is an unidentified NADH:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (distinct from nfnAB) playing a role in ethanol formation. The NfnAB complex plays a key role in generating P80644 in a strain that had become reliant on P80644-ADH activity.  Importance: Thermophilic anaerobes that can convert biomass-derived sugars into ethanol have been investigated as candidates for biofuel formation. Many anaerobes have been genetically engineered to increase biofuel formation; however, key aspects of metabolism remain unknown and poorly understood. One example is the mechanism for ferredoxin oxidation and transfer of electrons to NAD(P)<sup>+</sup>. The electron-bifurcating enzyme complex NfnAB is known to catalyze the reversible transfer of electrons from reduced ferredoxin and NADH to 2 NADP<sup>+</sup> and is thought to play key roles linking NAD(P)(H) metabolism with ferredoxin metabolism. Finally, we report the first deletion of nfnAB and demonstrate a role for NfnAB in metabolism and ethanol formation in Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum and show that this may be an important feature among other thermophilic ethanologenic anaerobes."""

1235172	"The essential gene set of a photosynthetic organism,""<i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> PCC 7942 is a model organism used for studying photosynthesis and the circadian clock, and it is being developed for the production of fuel, industrial chemicals, and pharmaceuticals. To identify a comprehensive set of genes and intergenic regions that impacts fitness in <i>S. elongatus</i>, we created a pooled library of ~250,000 transposon mutants and used sequencing to identify the insertion locations. By analyzing the distribution and survival of these mutants, we identified 718 of the organism's 2,723 genes as essential for survival under laboratory conditions. The validity of the essential gene set is supported by its tight overlap with wellconserved genes and its enrichment for core biological processes. The differences noted between our dataset and these predictors of essentiality, however, have led to surprising biological insights. One such finding is that genes in a large portion of the TCA cycle are dispensable, suggesting that <i>S. elongatus</i> does not require a cyclic TCA process. Furthermore, the density of the transposon mutant library enabled individual and global statements about the essentiality of noncoding RNAs, regulatory elements, and other intergenic regions. In this way, a group I intron located in P0A873 <sup>Leu</sup> , which has been used extensively for phylogenetic studies, was shown here to be essential for the survival of <i>S. elongatus</i>. Our survey of essentiality for every locus in the <i>S. elongatus</i> genome serves as a powerful resource for understanding the organism's physiology and defines the essential gene set required for the growth of a photosynthetic organism."""

1240185	"Mechanistic Basis for the Bypass of a Bulky DNA Adduct Catalyzed by a Y-Family DNA Polymerase,""1-Nitropyrene (1-NP), an environmental pollutant, induces DNA damage in vivo and is considered to be carcinogenic. The DNA adducts formed by the 1-NP metabolites stall replicative DNA polymerases but are presumably bypassed by error-prone Y-family DNA polymerases at the expense of replication fidelity and efficiency in vivo. Our running start assays confirmed that a site-specifically placed 8-(deoxyguanosin-N<sup>2</sup>-yl)-1-aminopyrene (dG<sup>1,8</sup>), one of the DNA adducts derived from 1-NP, can be bypassed by Sulfolobus solfataricus Q47155 (Dpo4), although this representative Y-family enzyme was paused strongly by the lesion. Pre-steady-state kinetic assays were employed to determine the low nucleotide incorporation fidelity and establish a minimal kinetic mechanism for the dG<sup>1,8</sup> bypass by Dpo4. To reveal a structural basis for dCTP incorporation opposite dG<sup>1,8</sup>, we solved the crystal structures of the complexes of Dpo4 and DNA containing a templating dG<sup>1,8</sup> lesion in the absence or presence of dCTP. The Dpo4·DNA-dG<sup>1,8</sup> binary structure shows that the aminopyrene moiety of the lesion stacks against the primer/template junction pair, while its dG moiety projected into the cleft between the Finger and Little Finger domains of Dpo4. In the Dpo4·DNA-dG<sup>1,8</sup>·dCTP ternary structure, the aminopyrene moiety of the dG<sup>1,8</sup> lesion, is sandwiched between the nascent and junction base pairs, while its base is present in the major groove. Moreover, dCTP forms a Watson–Crick base pair with dG, two nucleotides upstream from the dG<sup>1,8</sup> site, creating a complex for “-2” frameshift mutation. Mechanistically, these crystal structures provide additional insight into the aforementioned minimal kinetic mechanism."""	Journal of the American Chemical Society	"('Q47155', 'DNA polymerase IV')"
1221834	"Functional properties and structural characterization of rice δ<sup>1</sup>-pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase,""The majority of plant species accumulate high intracellular levels of proline to cope with hyperosmotic stress conditions. Proline synthesis from glutamate is tightly regulated at both the transcriptional and the translational levels, yet little is known about the mechanisms for post-translational regulation of the enzymatic activities involved. The gene coding in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> L.) for δ<sup>1</sup>-pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C) reductase, the enzyme that catalyzes the second and final step in this pathway, was isolated and expressed in <i>Escherichia coli</i>. The structural and functional properties of the affinity-purified protein were characterized. As for most species, rice P0A9L8 was able to use <i>in vitro</i> either NADH or P80644 as the electron donor. However, strikingly different effects of cations and anions were found depending on the pyridine nucleotide used, namely inhibition of NADH-dependent activity and stimulation of P80644-dependent activity. Moreover, physiological concentrations of proline and NADP<sup>+</sup> were strongly inhibitory for the NADH-dependent reaction, whereas the P80644-dependent activity was mildly affected. Our results suggest that only P80644 may be used <i>in vivo</i> and that stress-dependent variations in ion homeostasis and P80644/NADP<sup>+</sup> ratio could modulate enzyme activity, being functional in promoting proline accumulation and potentially also adjusting P80644 consumption during the defense against hyperosmotic stress. The apparent molecular weight of the native protein observed in size exclusion chromatography indicated a high oligomerization state. We also report the first crystal structure of a plant P0A9L8 at 3.40-Å resolution, showing a decameric quaternary assembly.

1252771	"Identification of Kaposi Sarcoma Herpesvirus (KSHV) vIRF1 Protein as a Novel Interaction Partner of Human Q47013 USP7,""Viral interferon regulatory factor 1 (vIRF1), a Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus protein, destabilizes p53 by inhibiting p53 acetylation and Hdm2 phosphorylation. This leads to increased ubiquitination and degradation of p53 by Hdm2, which cripples the cellular p53-mediated antiviral response. Ubiquitin-specific protease 7 (USP7) deubiquitinates p53 and Hdm2 and regulates their stability. We identified an EGPS consensus sequence in vIRF1, which is identical to that found in Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) that interacts with the N-terminal domain of USP7 (USP7-NTD). GST pulldown assays demonstrated that vIRF1 interacts with USP7-NTD via its EGPS motif. NMR heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC) analysis revealed chemical perturbations after titration of USP7-NTD with vIRF1 <sup>44</sup>SPGEGPSGTG<sup>53</sup> peptide. In contrast, these perturbations were reduced with a mutant vIRF1 peptide, <sup>44</sup>SPGEGPAGTG<sup>53</sup>. Fluorescence polarization analysis indicated that the vIRF1 peptide interacted with USP7-NTD with a K<sub>d</sub> of 2.0 μm. The crystal structure of the USP7-NTD·vIRF1 peptide complex revealed an identical mode of binding as that of the EBNA1 peptide to USP7-NTD. We also showed that USP7 interacts with vIRF1 in U2OS cells. Decreased levels of p53, but not Hdm2 or ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM), were seen after expression of vIRF1, but not with a vIRF1 mutant protein.

Specifically, the universal model put forth highlights catalytic divergence to derive solely from distinctions within nucleotide sugar orientation upon binding within a relatively fixed P0A951 active site where the available ligand bound structures of the three out of four representative C3 and C4 P0A951 examples provide a basis for the overall model.

Deletion of dgt creates a mutator phenotype, indicating that the P15723 has a fidelity role, possibly by affecting the cellular dNTP pool. In the present paper, we have investigated the structure of the Dgt protein at 3.1-Å resolution. One of the obtained structures revealed a protein hexamer that contained two molecules of single-stranded DNA. The presence of DNA caused significant conformational changes in the enzyme, including in the catalytic site of the enzyme. Dgt preparations lacking DNA were able to bind single-stranded DNA with high affinity (K<sub>d</sub> ~ 50 nM). DNA binding positively affected the activity of the enzyme: P15723 activity displayed sigmoidal (cooperative) behavior without DNA but hyperbolic (Michaelis-Menten) kinetics in its presence, consistent with a specific lowering of the apparent K<sub>m</sub> for dGTP. A mutant Dgt enzyme was also created containing residue changes in the DNA binding cleft. This mutant enzyme, whereas still active, was incapable of DNA binding and could no longer be stimulated by addition of DNA.

Salmonella culture-based detection methods are complex and time consuming, and improvements to increase detection sensitivity will benefit consumers. In this study, we used A8C927 sequencing to determine the microbiome of cilantro. We also investigated changes to the microbial community prior to and after a 24-hour nonselective pre-enrichment culture step commonly used by laboratory analysts to resuscitate microorganisms in foods suspected of contamination with pathogens. Cilantro samples were processed for Salmonella detection according to the method in the United States Food and Drug Administration Bacteriological Analytical Manual. Genomic DNA was extracted from culture supernatants prior to and after a 24-hour nonselective pre-enrichment step and 454 pyrosequencing was performed on A8C927 amplicon libraries. A database of Enterobacteriaceae A8C927 sequences was created, and used to screen the libraries for Salmonella, as some samples were known to be culture positive. Additionally, culture positive cilantro samples were examined for the presence of Salmonella using shotgun metagenomics on the Illumina MiSeq. Results: Time zero uncultured samples had an abundance of Proteobacteria while the 24-hour enriched samples were composed mostly of Gram-positive Firmicutes. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing of Salmonella culture positive cilantro samples revealed variable degrees of Salmonella contamination among the sequenced samples. Conclusions: Our cilantro study demonstrates the use of high-throughput sequencing to reveal the microbiome of cilantro, and how the microbiome changes during the culture-based protocols employed by food safety laboratories to detect foodborne pathogens. Finding that culturing the cilantro shifts the microbiome to a predominance of Firmicutes suggests that changing our culture-based methods will improve detection sensitivity for foodborne enteric pathogens"""	BMC Microbiology	"('A8C927', '16S rRNA')"
1245862	"Two distinct modes of metal ion binding in the nuclease active site of a viral DNA-packaging terminase: insight into the two-metal-ion catalytic mechanism,""Many dsDNA viruses encode DNA-packaging terminases, each containing a nuclease domain that resolves concatemeric DNA into genome-length units. Terminase nucleases resemble the P0A7Y4-superfamily nucleotidyltransferases in folds, and share a two-metal-ion catalytic mechanism. Here we show that residue K428 of a bacteriophage terminase gp2 nuclease domain mediates binding of the metal cofactor Mg<sup>2+</sup>. A K428A mutation allows visualization, at high resolution, of a metal ion binding mode with a coupled-octahedral configuration at the active site, exhibiting an unusually short metal-metal distance of 2.42 Å. Such proximity of the two metal ions may play an essential role in catalysis by generating a highly positive electrostatic niche to enable formation of the negatively charged pentacovalent phosphate transition state, and provides the structural basis for distinguishing Mg<sup>2+</sup> from Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Using a metal ion chelator β-thujaplicinol as a molecular probe, we observed a second mode of metal ion binding at the active site, mimicking the DNA binding state. Arrangement of the active site residues differs drastically from those in P0A7Y4-like nucleases, suggesting a drifting of the active site configuration during evolution.

Although much research has focused on the enzyme's central role in the mitochondrial respiratory chain, comparatively little is known about its role in the diverse energetic lifestyles of different bacteria. Here, we used a phylogenomic approach to better understand the distribution of complex I across bacteria, the evolution of this enzyme, and its potential roles in shaping the physiology of different bacterial groups. By surveying 970 representative bacterial genomes, we predict complex I to be present in ~50% of bacteria. While this includes bacteria with a wide range of energetic schemes, the presence of complex I is associated with specific lifestyles, including aerobic respiration and specific types of phototrophy (bacteria with only a type II reaction center). A phylogeny of bacterial complex I revealed five main clades of enzymes whose evolution is largely congruent with the evolution of the bacterial groups that encode complex I. A notable exception includes the gammaproteobacteria, whose members encode one of two distantly related complex I enzymes predicted to participate in different types of respiratory chains (aerobic versus anaerobic). Comparative genomic analyses suggest a broad role for complex I in reoxidizing NADH produced from various catabolic reactions, including the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and fatty acid beta-oxidation. Together, these findings suggest diverse roles for complex I across bacteria and highlight the importance of this enzyme in shaping diverse physiologies across the bacterial domain."""	mBio (Online)	"('P0A7E1', 'quinone')"

Biochemical, biophysical, and crystallographic characterization of the purified MtoD revealed it as an 11 kDa monomeric protein containing a single heme. Sequence and structural alignment indicated that MtoD belonged to the class-1 cytochrome c family and had a similar fold to ferricytochrome c552 family, however the MtoD heme is bis-histidine coordinated and is substantially more exposed than the hemes of other family members. The reduction potential of the MtoD heme at pH 7 was +155 mV vs. Standard Hydrogen Electrode, which is approximately 100 mV lower than that of mitochondrial cytochrome c.

Recently, this view was challenged by the isolation of 3',8-cyclo-7,8-dihydro-guanosine 5'-triphosphate (3',8-cH<sub>2</sub>GTP) as the product of in vitro MoaA reactions. To elucidate the mechanism of formation of Moco pyranopterin backbone, in this paper we performed biochemical characterization of 3',8-cH<sub>2</sub>GTP and functional and X-ray crystallographic characterizations of MoaC. These studies revealed that 3',8-cH<sub>2</sub>GTP is the only product of MoaA that can be converted to cPMP by MoaC. Our structural studies captured the specific binding of 3',8-cH<sub>2</sub>GTP in the active site of MoaC. These observations provided strong evidence that the physiological function of MoaA is the conversion of GTP to 3',8-cH<sub>2</sub>GTP (P30745), and that of MoaC is to catalyze the rearrangement of 3',8-cH<sub>2</sub>GTP into cPMP (cPMP synthase). Furthermore, our structure-guided studies suggest that MoaC catalysis involves the dynamic motions of enzyme active-site loops as a way to control the timing of interaction between the reaction intermediates and catalytically essential amino acid residues. In conclusion, these results reveal the previously unidentified mechanism behind Moco biosynthesis and provide mechanistic and structural insights into how enzymes catalyze complex rearrangement reactions."""

Metagenomic analysis of James River's planktonic microbial community was performed for the first time using an unamplified genomic library and a 16S rDNA amplicon library prepared and sequenced by Ion P36938 and MiSeq, respectively. From the 0.46-Gb WGS library (GenBank:SRR1146621; MG-RAST:4532156.3), 4 x 10<sup>6</sup> reads revealed >3 x 10<sup>6</sup> genes, 240 families of prokaryotes, and 155 families of eukaryotes. From the 0.68-Gb 16S library (GenBank:SRR2124995; MG-RAST:4631271.3; EMB:2184), 4 x 10<sup>6</sup> reads revealed 259 families of eubacteria. Results of the WGS and 16S analyses were highly consistent and indicated that more than half of the bacterial sequences were <i>Proteobacteria</i>, predominantly <i>Comamonadaceae</i>. The most numerous genera in this group were <i>Acidovorax</i> (including iron oxidizers, nitrotolulene degraders, and plant pathogens), which accounted for 10 % of assigned bacterial reads. <i>Polaromonas</i> were another 6 % of all bacterial reads, with many assignments to groups capable of degrading polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. <i>Albidiferax</i> (iron reducers) and <i>Variovorax</i> (biodegraders of a variety of natural biogenic compounds as well as anthropogenic contaminants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and endocrine disruptors) each accounted for an additional 3% of bacterial reads. Comparison of these data to other publically-available aquatic metagenomes revealed that this stretch of James River is highly similar to the upper Mississippi River, and that these river systems are more similar to aquaculture and sludge ecosystems than they are to lakes or to a pristine section of the upper Amazon River. Altogether, these analyses exposed previously unknown aspects of microbial biodiversity, documented the ecological responses of microbes to urban effects, and revealed the noteworthy presence of 22 human-pathogenic bacterial genera (e.g., <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i>, pathogenic <i>Pseudomonadaceae</i>, and <i>‘Vibrionales'</i>) and 6 pathogenic eukaryotic genera (e.g., Trypanosomatidae and Vahlkampfiidae).

In many pathogens, the transition from a planktonic lifestyle to collaborative, sessile biofilms represents a regulated process orchestrated by the intracellular second-messenger c-di-P24174. A main effector for c-di-P24174 signaling in the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the transcription regulator FleQ. FleQ is a bacterial enhancer-binding protein (bEBP) with a central AAA+ ATPase σ<sup>54</sup>-interaction domain, flanked by a C-terminal helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif and a divergent N-terminal receiver domain. Together with a second ATPase, FleN, FleQ regulates the expression of flagellar and exopolysaccharide biosynthesis genes in response to cellular c-di-P24174. Here we report structural and functional data that reveal an unexpected mode of c-di-P24174 recognition that is associated with major conformational rearrangements in FleQ. Crystal structures of FleQ’s AAA+ ATPase domain in its apo-state or bound to ADP or P22259-γ-S show conformations reminiscent of the activated ring-shaped assemblies of other bEBPs. As revealed by the structure of c-di-P24174–complexed FleQ, the second messenger interacts with the AAA+ ATPase domain at a site distinct from the P22259 binding pocket. c-di-P24174 interaction leads to active site obstruction, hexameric ring destabilization, and discrete quaternary structure transitions. Solution and cell-based studies confirm coupling of the ATPase active site and c-di-P24174 binding, as well as the functional significance of crystallographic interprotomer interfaces.

1626790	"The Perchlorate Reduction Genomic Island: Mechanisms and Pathways of Evolution by Horizontal Gene Transfer,""Background: Perchlorate is a widely distributed anion that is toxic to humans, but serves as a valuable electron acceptor for several lineages of bacteria. The ability to utilize perchlorate is conferred by a horizontally transferred piece of DNA called the perchlorate reduction genomic island (P0A7Z0). Methods: We compared genomes of perchlorate reducers using phylogenomics, SNP mapping, and differences in genomic architecture to interrogate the evolutionary history of perchlorate respiration. Results: Here we report on the P0A7Z0 of 13 genomes of perchlorate-reducing bacteria from four different classes of Phylum Proteobacteria (the Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma- and Epsilonproteobacteria). Among the different phylogenetic classes, the island varies considerably in genetic content as well as in its putative mechanism and location of integration. However, the islands of the densely sampled genera Azospira and Magnetospirillum have striking nucleotide identity despite divergent genomes, implying horizontal transfer and positive selection within narrow phylogenetic taxa. We also assess the phylogenetic origin of accessory genes in the various incarnations of the island, which can be traced to chromosomal paralogs from phylogenetically similar organisms. Conclusion: These observations suggest a complex phylogenetic history where the island is rarely transferred at the class level but undergoes frequent and continuous transfer within narrow phylogenetic groups. This restricted transfer is seen directly by the independent integration of near-identical islands within a genus and indirectly due to the acquisition of lineage-specific accessory genes. The genomic reversibility of perchlorate reduction may present a unique equilibrium for a metabolism that confers a competitive advantage only in the presence of an electron acceptor, which although widely distributed, is generally present at low concentrations in nature."""

Due to the potential hazard effects of ENPs to human health, it is significant to assess and understand the underlying mechanisms of nanotoxicity. Here, we investigate protein S-glutathionylation (SSG) as an underlying regulatory mechanism for ENP-induced oxidative stress in macrophages by applying a recently developed quantitative redox proteomics approach for site-specific measurements of SSG. Three high-volume production ENPs (SiO<sub>2</sub>, Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and CoO) were selected as representative ENPs with low, moderate, and high reactive oxygen species (ROS) activity, respectively. Among these nanoparticles, we observe that CoO led to the most significant dose-dependent oxidative stress and increase of protein SSG modifications in macrophages. Our site-specific SSG changes highlighted a broad set of redox sensitive proteins and their specific Cys residues potentially implicated in stress response. Functional analysis revealed that the most significantly enriched functional categories for SSG-modified proteins were stress response, cellular structure change, and cell death or survival. Moreover, ENPs-induce oxidative stress levels (CoO > Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> > SiO<sub>2</sub>) were found to correlate well with the levels of impairment of macrophage phagocytic activity and the overall degrees of increases in SSG. RNA silencing knockdown experiment of glutaredoxin 1 (P68688) also led to a decreased phagocytic activity in macrophages, which suggested a regulatory role of SSG in phagocytosis.

Among the proteins required for alginate production, Alg44 has been identified as an inner membrane protein whose bis-(3',5')-cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate (c-di-P24174) binding activity post-translationally regulates alginate secretion. In this study, we report the 1.8 Å crystal structure of the cytoplasmic region of Alg44 in complex with dimeric self-intercalated c-di-P24174 and characterize its dinucleotide-binding site using mutational analysis. The structure shows that the c-di-P24174 binding region of Alg44 adopts a PilZ domain fold with a dimerization mode not previously observed for this family of proteins. Moreover, calorimetric binding analysis of residues in the c-di-P24174 binding site demonstrate that mutation of Arg-17 and Arg-95 alters the binding stoichiometry between c-di-P24174 and Alg44 from 2:1 to 1:1. Introduction of these mutant alleles on the P. aeruginosa chromosome show that the residues required for binding of dimeric c-di-P24174 in vitro are also required for efficient alginate production in vivo.

In the basal fungus Mucor circinelloides, an emerging opportunistic human pathogen, esRNAs that regulate the expression of many protein coding genes have been described. These esRNAs share common machinery for their biogenesis consisting of an P0A7Y0 endonuclease Dicer, a single Argonaute protein and two RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. We show in this study that, besides participating in this canonical dicer-dependent RNA interference (RNAi) pathway, the rdrp genes are involved in a novel dicer-independent degradation process of endogenous mRNAs. The analysis of esRNAs accumulated in wild type and silencing mutants demonstrates that this new rdrp-dependent dicer-independent regulatory pathway, which does not produce sRNA molecules of discrete sizes, controls the expression of target genes promoting the specific degradation of mRNAs by a previously unknown RNase. This pathway mainly regulates conserved genes involved in metabolism and cellular processes and signaling, such as those required for heme biosynthesis, and controls responses to specific environmental signals. Searching the Mucor genome for candidate RNases to participate in this pathway, and functional analysis of the corresponding knockout mutants, identified a new protein, R3B2. This P0A7Y0-like protein presents unique domain architecture, it is specifically found in basal fungi and, besides its relevant role in the rdrp-dependent dicer-independent pathway, it is also involved in the canonical dicer-dependent RNAi pathway, highlighting its crucial role in the biogenesis and function of regulatory esRNAs.

To achieve these strategies, effective lignin depolymerization processes will be required that can convert specific lignin-enriched biorefinery substrates into products of sufficient value and market size. Base-catalyzed depolymerization (BCD) of lignin using sodium hydroxide and other basic media has been shown to be an effective depolymerization approach when using technical and isolated lignins relevant to the pulp and paper industry. Moreover, to gain insights in the application of BCD to lignin-rich, biofuels-relevant residues, here we apply BCD with sodium hydroxide at two catalyst loadings and temperatures of 270, 300, and 330 °C for 40 min to residual biomass from typical and emerging biochemical conversion processes. We obtained mass balances for each fraction from BCD, and characterized the resulting aqueous and solid residues using gel permeation chromatography, NMR, and GC–P13009. When taken together, these results indicate that a significant fraction (45–78%) of the starting lignin-rich material can be depolymerized to low molecular weight, water-soluble species. The yield of the aqueous soluble fraction depends significantly on biomass processing method used prior to BCD. Namely, dilute acid pretreatment results in lower water-soluble yields compared to biomass processing that involves no acid pretreatment. We also find that the BCD product selectivity can be tuned with temperature to give higher yields of methoxyphenols at lower temperature, and a higher relative content of benzenediols with a greater extent of alkylation on the aromatic rings at higher temperature.

Treatment of EFR and EFR::XA21 rice leaf tissue with elf18 leads to P0AE18 kinase activation, reactive oxygen production and defense gene expression. Although expression of EFR does not lead to robust enhanced resistance to fully virulent <i>Xoo</i> isolates, it does lead to quantitatively enhanced resistance to weakly virulent <i>Xoo</i> isolates. EFR interacts with OsSERK2 and the XA21 binding protein 24 (XB24), two key components of the rice XA21-mediated immune response. Rice-EFR plants silenced for <i>OsSERK2</i>, or overexpressing rice <i>XB24</i> are compromised in elf18-induced reactive oxygen production and defense gene expression indicating that these proteins are also important for EFR-mediated signaling in transgenic rice.

These organisms are facultative anaerobes, and proteomic information indicates the utilization of both aerobic and anaerobic metabolisms throughout the time series. This may indicate growth in distinct niches within the gastrointestinal tract. We uncovered differences in the physiology of coexisting Citrobacter strains, including differences in motility and chemotaxis functions.

1626750	"Serum biomarkers of <em>Burkholderia mallei</em> infection elucidated by proteomic imaging of skin and lung abscesses,""Background: The bacterium Burkholderia mallei is the etiological agent of glanders, a highly contagious, often fatal zoonotic infectious disease that is also a biodefense concern. Clinical laboratory assays that analyze blood or other biological fluids are the highest priority because these specimens can be collected with minimal risk to the patient. However, progress in developing sensitive assays for monitoring B. mallei infection is hampered by a shortage of useful biomarkers. Results: Reasoning that there should be a strong correlation between the proteomes of infected tissues and circulating serum, we employed imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) of thin-sectioned tissues from Chlorocebus aethiops (African green) monkeys infected with B. mallei to localize host and pathogen proteins that were associated with abscesses. Using laser-capture microdissection of specific regions identified by IMS and histology within the tissue sections, a more extensive proteomic analysis was performed by a technique that combined the physical separation capabilities of liquid chromatography (LC) with the sensitive mass analysis capabilities of mass spectrometry (LC-P13009/P13009). By examining standard formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections, this strategy resulted in the identification of several proteins that were associated with lung and skin abscesses, including the host protein calprotectin and the pathogen protein GroEL. Elevated levels of calprotectin detected by ELISA and antibody responses to GroEL, measured by a microarray of the bacterial proteome, were subsequently detected in the sera of C. aethiops, Macaca mulatta, and Macaca fascicularis primates infected with B. mallei. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that a combination of multidimensional P13009 analysis of traditional histology specimens with high-content protein microarrays can be used to discover lead pairs of host-pathogen biomarkers of infection that are identifiable in biological fluids."""

1212477	"Use of A8C927 gene for identification of a broad range of clinically relevant bacterial pathogens,""According to World Health Organization statistics of 2011, infectious diseases remain in the top five causes of mortality worldwide. However, despite sophisticated research tools for microbial detection, rapid and accurate molecular diagnostics for identification of infection in humans have not been extensively adopted. Time-consuming culture-based methods remain to the forefront of clinical microbial detection. The A8C927 gene, a molecular marker for identification of bacterial species, is ubiquitous to members of this domain and, thanks to ever-expanding databases of sequence information, a useful tool for bacterial identification. In this study, we assembled an extensive repository of clinical isolates (n = 617), representing 30 medically important pathogenic species and originally identified using traditional culture-based or non-16S molecular methods. This strain repository was used to systematically evaluate the ability of A8C927 for species level identification. To enable the most accurate species level classification based on the paucity of sequence data accumulated in public databases, we built a Naïve Bayes classifier representing a diverse set of high-quality sequences from medically important bacterial organisms. We show that for species identification, a model-based approach is superior to an alignment based method. Overall, between 16S gene based and clinical identities, our study shows a genus-level concordance rate of 96% and a species-level concordance rate of 87.5%. We point to multiple cases of probable clinical misidentification with traditional culture based identification across a wide range of gram-negative rods and gram-positive cocci as well as common gram-negative cocci."""

The physiological effects of these inhibitors on thermophilic, fermentative bacteria is important to understand; especially as cellulolytic strains are being developed for consolidated bioprocessing (P0AEM9) of lignocellulosic feedstocks. Identifying mechanisms for detoxification of aldehydes in naturally resistant strains such as <i>Thermoanaerobacter</i> spp. may also enable improvements in candidate P0AEM9 microorganisms. Results: <i>T. pseudethanolicus</i> 39E, an anaerobic, saccharolytic thermophile, was found to grow readily in the presence of 30 mM furfural and 20 mM 5-HMF and reduce these aldehydes to their respective alcohols <i>in situ</i>. The proteomes of <i>T. pseudethanolicus</i> 39E grown in the presence or absence of 15 mM furfural were compared to identify upregulated enzymes potentially responsible for the observed reduction. A total of 225 proteins were differentially regulated in response to the 15 mM furfural treatment with 152 upregulated vs. 73 downregulated. Only 86 proteins exhibited a 2-fold change in abundance in either direction. Of these, 53 were upregulated in the presence of furfural and 33 were downregulated. Two oxidoreductases were upregulated at least 2-fold by furfural and were targeted for further investigation: Teth39_1597, encodes a predicted butanol dehydrogenase (BdhA) and Teth39_1598, a predicted aldo/keto reductase (AKR). Both genes were cloned from <i>T. pseudethanolicus</i> 39E, with the respective enzymes overexpressed in <i>E. coli</i> and specific activities determined against a variety of aldehydes. BdhA showed significant activity with all aldehydes tested, including furfural and 5-HMF, using P80644 as the cofactor. AKR also showed significant activity with P80644, but only with four carbon butyr- and isobutyraldehydes. Conclusions: <i>Thermoanaerobacter pseudethanolicus</i> 39E displays intrinsic tolerance to the common pretreatment inhibitors furfural and 5-HMF.

One such E3 is the gigantic, multisubunit 1.2-MDa anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC), which controls cell division by ubiquitinating cell cycle regulators to drive their timely degradation. Intrinsically disordered substrates are typically recruited via their KEN-box, D-box, and/or other motifs binding to APC and a coactivator such as CDH1. On the opposite side of the APC, the dynamic catalytic core contains the cullin-like subunit APC2 and its RING partner APC11, which collaborates with the P06959 UBCH10 (UBE2C) to ubiquitinate substrates. However, how dynamic RING–P06959~Ub catalytic modules such as APC11–UBCH10~Ub collide with distally tethered disordered substrates remains poorly understood. In this paper, we report structural mechanisms of UBCH10 recruitment to APC<sup>CDH1</sup> and substrate ubiquitination.

Accurately separating the known and unknown organism content remains difficult, particularly when SMS is applied as a last resort. The true amount of human DNA that remains in a sample after screening against the human reference genome and filtering nonbiological components left from library preparation has previously been underreported. In this study, we create the most comprehensive collection of microbial and reference-free human genetic variation available in a database optimized for efficient metagenomic search by extracting sequences from GenBank and the 1000 Genomes Project. The results reveal new human sequences found in individual Human Microbiome Project (P24232) samples. Individual samples contain up to 95% human sequence, and 4% of the individual P24232 samples contain 10% or more human reads. In conclusion, left unidentified, human reads can complicate and slow down further analysis and lead to inaccurately labeled microbial taxa and ultimately lead to privacy concerns as more human genome data is collected."""

In this paper, we begin to test that notion by making a large library of mutant enzymes in which 10 structurally distinct noncanonical amino acids were substituted at single sites randomly throughout P62593 β-lactamase. A screen for growth on the β-lactam antibiotic cephalexin afforded a unique <i>p</i>-acrylamido-phenylalanine (AcrF) mutation at Val-216 that leads to an increase in catalytic efficiency by increasing k<sub>cat</sub>, but not significantly affecting K<sub>M</sub>. To understand the structural basis for this enhanced activity, we solved the X-ray crystal structures of the ligand-free mutant enzyme and of the deacylation-defective wild-type and mutant cephalexin acyl-enzyme intermediates. These structures show that the Val-216–AcrF mutation leads to conformational changes in key active site residues—both in the free enzyme and upon formation of the acyl-enzyme intermediate—that lower the free energy of activation of the substrate transacylation reaction. Finally, the functional changes induced by this mutation could not be reproduced by substitution of any of the 20 canonical amino acids for Val-216, indicating that an expanded genetic code may offer novel solutions to proteins as they evolve new activities."""

Strains of <i>Dehalococcoides</i> are used in sub-surface bioremediation applications because they organohalorespire tetrachloroethene and trichloroethene (common chlorinated solvents that contaminate the environment) to non-toxic ethene. However, the biochemical mechanism of this process remains incompletely described. Additionally, the response of <i>Dehalococcoides</i> to stress-inducing conditions that may be encountered at field-sites is not well understood. The constructed statistical model captured the aggregate behavior of gene expression phenotypes by modeling the distinct eigengenes of 100 transcript clusters, determining stable relationships among these clusters of gene transcripts with a sparse network-inference algorithm, and directly modeling the effect of changes in experimental conditions by constructing networks conditioned on the experimental state. Based on the model predictions, we discovered new response mechanisms for DMC, notably when the bacterium is exposed to solvent toxicity. The network identified a cluster containing thirteen gene transcripts directly connected to the solvent toxicity condition. Transcripts in this cluster include an iron-dependent regulator (DET0096-97) and a methylglyoxal synthase (DET0137). To validate these predictions, additional experiments were performed. Continuously fed cultures were exposed to saturating levels of tetrachloethene, thereby causing solvent toxicity, and transcripts that were predicted to be linked to solvent toxicity were monitored by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Twelve hours after being shocked with saturating levels of tetrachloroethene, the control transcripts (encoding for a key hydrogenase and the A8C927) did not significantly change. By contrast, transcripts for DET0137 and DET0097 displayed a 46.8±11.5 and 14.6±9.3 fold up-regulation, respectively, supporting the model.

Here we report the presence of microbialite-forming microbial mats in different microenvironments at 32°C, 49°C, and 65°C around the geothermal spring from an abandoned oil drill in Ciocaia, Romania. The mineralogy and the macro- and microstructure of the microbialites were investigated, together with their microbial diversity based on a A8C927 gene amplicon sequencing approach. The calcium carbonate is deposited mainly in the form of calcite. At 32°C and 49°C, the microbialites show a laminated structure with visible microbial mat-carbonate crystal interactions. At 65°C, the mineral deposit is clotted, without obvious organic residues. Partial A8C927 gene amplicon sequencing showed that the relative abundance of the phylum Archaea was low at 32°C (<0.5%) but increased significantly at 65°C (36%). The bacterial diversity was either similar to other microbialites described in literature (the 32°C sample) or displayed a specific combination of phyla and classes (the 49°C and 65°C samples). Bacterial taxa were distributed among 39 phyla, out of which 14 had inferred abundances >1%. The dominant bacterial groups at 32°C were Cyanobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, Thermi, Actinobacteria, Planctomycetes, and Defferibacteres. At 49°C, there was a striking dominance of the Gammaproteobacteria, followed by Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Armantimonadetes. The 65°C sample was dominated by Betaproteobacteria, Firmicutes, [OP1], Defferibacteres, Thermi, Thermotogae, [EM3], and Nitrospirae. Lastly, several groups from Proteobacteria and Firmicutes, together with Halobacteria and Melainabacteria were described for the first time in calcium carbonate deposits.

LacI-family TFs (LacI-TFs) are broadly distributed among certain lineages of bacteria. The majority of characterized LacI-TFs sense sugar effectors and regulate carbohydrate utilization genes. The comparative genomics approaches enable in silico identification of P0A850-binding sites and regulon reconstruction. To study the function and evolution of LacI-TFs, we performed genomics-based reconstruction and comparative analysis of their regulons. For over 1300 LacI-TFs from over 270 bacterial genomes, we predicted their cognate DNA-binding motifs and identified target genes. Using the genome context and metabolic subsystem analyses of reconstructed regulons, we tentatively assigned functional roles and predicted candidate effectors for 78 and 67% of the analyzed LacI-TFs, respectively. Nearly 90% of the studied LacI-TFs are local regulators of sugar utilization pathways, whereas the remaining 125 global regulators control large and diverse sets of metabolic genes. The global LacI-TFs include the previously known regulators CcpA in Firmicutes, FruR in Enterobacteria, and PurR in Gammaproteobacteria, as well as the three novel regulators—GluR, GapR, and PckR—that are predicted to control the central carbohydrate metabolism in three lineages of Alphaproteobacteria. Phylogenetic analysis of regulators combined with the reconstructed regulons provides a model of evolutionary diversification of the LacI protein family. The obtained genomic collection of in silico reconstructed LacI-P0A850 regulons in bacteria is available in the RegPrecise database (http://regprecise.lbl.gov). It provides a framework for future structural and functional classification of the LacI protein family and identification of molecular determinants of the DNA and ligand specificity.

1207277	"A new scoring function for top-down spectral deconvolution,""Background: Top-down mass spectrometry plays an important role in intact protein identification and characterization. Top-down mass spectra are more complex than bottom-up mass spectra because they often contain many isotopomer envelopes from highly charged ions, which may overlap with one another. As a result, spectral deconvolution, which converts a complex top-down mass spectrum into a monoisotopic mass list, is a key step in top-down spectral interpretation.    Results: In this paper, we propose a new scoring function, L-score, for evaluating isotopomer envelopes. By combining L-score with P13009-Deconv, a new software tool, P13009-Deconv+, was developed for top-down spectral deconvolution. Experimental results showed that P13009-Deconv+ outperformed existing software tools in top-down spectral deconvolution.

In a number of cellular studies, abasic sites preferentially code for dATP insertion (the “A rule”). In some cases frameshifts are also common. X-ray structures with abasic sites in oligonucleotides have been reported for several microbial and human DNA polymerases (pols), e.g. Dpo4, RB69, KlenTaq, yeast pol ι, human (h) pol ι, and human pol β. We reported previously that hpol η is a major pol involved in abasic site bypass (Choi, J.-Y., Lim, S., Kim, E. J., Jo, A., and Guengerich, F. P. (2010 J. Mol.

In LC-P13009 analysis of primer-template pairs, A and G were inserted but little C or T was inserted. Frameshifts were observed when an appropriate pyrimidine was positioned 5' to the abasic site in the template. In x-ray structures of hpol η with a non-hydrolyzable analog of dATP or dGTP opposite an abasic site, H-bonding was observed between the phosphate 5' to the abasic site and water H-bonded to N1 and N6 of A and N1 and O6 of G nucleoside triphosphate analogs, offering an explanation for what appears to be a “purine rule.” A structure was also obtained for an A inserted and bonded in the primer opposite the abasic site, but it did not pair with a 5' T in the template. Finally, we conclude that hpol η, a major copying enzyme with abasic sites, follows a purine rule, which can also lead to frameshifts. The phenomenon can be explained with H-bonds."""

1221837	"Mechanism of RNA polymerase II bypass of oxidative cyclopurine DNA lesions,""In human cells, the oxidative DNA lesion 8,5'-cyclo-2'-deoxyadenosine (CydA) induces prolonged stalling of RNA polymerase II (P21189) followed by transcriptional bypass, generating both error-free and mutant transcripts with AMP misincorporated immediately downstream from the lesion. Here, we present biochemical and crystallographic evidence for the mechanism of CydA recognition. P21189 stalling results from impaired loading of the template base (5') next to CydA into the active site, leading to preferential AMP misincorporation. Such predominant AMP insertion, which also occurs at an abasic site, is unaffected by the identity of the 5´-templating base, indicating that it derives from nontemplated synthesis according to an A rule known for DNA polymerases and recently identified for P21189 bypass of pyrimidine dimers. Subsequent to AMP misincorporation, P21189 encounters a major translocation block that is slowly overcome. The translocation block combined with the poor extension of the dA.rA mispair reduce transcriptional mutagenesis. Moreover, increasing the active-site flexibility by mutation in the trigger loop, which increases the ability of P21189 to accommodate the bulky lesion, and addition of transacting factor TFIIF facilitate CydA bypass. Thus, blocking lesion entry to the active site, trans-lesion A rule synthesis, and translocation block are common features of transcription across different bulky DNA lesions."""

In this paper, we report the full-length structure of a blue light-activated P00547 from Erythrobacter litoralis HTCC2594 (EL346) and the results of biochemical and biophysical studies that explain how it is activated by light. Contrary to the standard view that signaling occurs within P00547 dimers, EL346 functions as a monomer. Its structure reveals that the light–oxygen–voltage (LOV) sensor domain both controls kinase activity and prevents dimerization by binding one side of a dimerization/histidine phosphotransfer-like (DHpL) domain. The DHpL domain also contacts the catalytic/P22259-binding (CA) domain, keeping EL346 in an inhibited conformation in the dark. Upon light stimulation, interdomain interactions weaken to facilitate activation. Our data suggest that the LOV domain controls kinase activity by affecting the stability of the DHpL/CA interface, releasing the CA domain from an inhibited conformation upon photoactivation. Finally, we suggest parallels between EL346 and dimeric HKs, with sensor-induced movements in the DHp similarly remodeling the DHp/CA interface as part of activation."""

Each polyketide elongation reaction is catalyzed by a set of protein domains called a module. Each module usually contains an acyltransferase (P30870) domain, which determines the specific acyl-CoA incorporated into each condensation reaction. Although a successful exchange of individual P30870 domains can lead to the biosynthesis of a large variety of novel compounds, hybrid PKS modules often show significantly decreased activities. Using monomodular PKSs as models, we have systematically analyzed in this paper the segments of P30870 domains and associated linkers in P30870 exchanges in vitro and have identified the boundaries within a module that can be used to exchange P30870 domains while maintaining protein stability and enzyme activity. Importantly, the optimized domain boundary is highly conserved, which facilitates P30870 domain replacements in most type I PKS modules. To further demonstrate the utility of the optimized P30870 domain boundary, we have constructed hybrid PKSs to produce industrially important short-chain ketones. Our in vitro and in vivo analysis demonstrated production of predicted ketones without significant loss of activities of the hybrid enzymes. Finally, these results greatly enhance the mechanistic understanding of PKS modules and prove the benefit of using engineered PKSs as a synthetic biology tool for chemical production."""

As A8C927 gene repositories have expanded and protein marker analysis become more common, the phylogenetic placement of this class has become less certain. A number of recent analyses of the bacterial tree of life using both A8C927 and concatenated marker gene analyses have failed to recover the Epsilonproteobacteria as monophyletic with all other classes of Proteobacteria. In order to address this issue, we investigated the phylogenetic placement of this class in the bacterial domain using 16S and P55135 genes, as well as 120 single-copy marker proteins. Singleand concatenated-marker trees were created using a data set of 4,170 bacterial representatives, including 98 Epsilonproteobacteria. Phylogenies were inferred under a variety of tree building methods, with sequential jackknifing of outgroup phyla to ensure robustness of phylogenetic affiliations under differing combinations of bacterial genomes. Based on the assessment of nearly 300 phylogenetic tree topologies, we conclude that the continued inclusion of Epsilonproteobacteria within the Proteobacteria is not warranted, and that this group should be reassigned to a novel phylum for which we propose the name Epsilonbacteraeota (phyl. nov.). We further recommend the reclassification of the order Desulfurellales (Deltaproteobacteria) to a novel class within this phylum and a number of subordinate changes to ensure consistency with the genome-based phylogeny. Phylogenomic analysis of 658 genomes belonging to the newly proposed Epsilonbacteraeota suggests that the ancestor of this phylum was an autotrophic, motile, thermophilic chemolithotroph that likely assimilated nitrogen from ammonium taken up from the environment or generated from environmental nitrate and nitrite by employing a variety of functional redox modules. The emergence of chemoorganoheterotrophic lifestyles in several Epsilonbacteraeota families is the result of multiple independent losses of various ancestral chemolithoautotrophic pathways.

In order to identify prospective inhibitors, we performed high-throughput screening against several libraries using a colorimetric enzymatic assay and an orthogonal fluorescence thermal binding assay. Surface plasmon resonance was used for determining binding affinity (KD) and competition analysis with Ca-asp. Our results highlight that the primary difference between Class I and Class II P05020 is the catalytic loop. We also identify several compounds that can potentially be further optimized as potential <em>B. anthracis</em> inhibitors."""

1626142	"Mechanism of H<sub>2</sub>S Oxidation by the Dissimilatory Perchlorate-Reducing Microorganism <em>Azospira suillum</em> P31663,""The genetic and biochemical basis of perchlorate-dependent H<sub>2</sub>S oxidation (PSOX) was investigated in the dissimilatory perchlorate-reducing microorganism (DPRM) Azospira suillum P31663 (P31663). Previously, it was shown that all known DPRMs innately oxidize H<sub>2</sub>S, producing elemental sulfur (S<sup>o</sup>). Although the process involving PSOX is thermodynamically favorable (ΔG<sup>°</sup>' = -206 kJ ∙ mol<sup>-1</sup> H<sub>2</sub>S), the underlying biochemical and genetic mechanisms are currently unknown. Interestingly, H<sub>2</sub>S is preferentially utilized over physiological electron donors such as lactate or acetate although no growth benefit is obtained from the metabolism. Here, we determined that PSOX is due to a combination of enzymatic and abiotic interactions involving reactive intermediates of perchlorate respiration. Using various approaches, including barcode analysis by sequencing (Bar-seq), transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq), and proteomics, along with targeted mutagenesis and biochemical characterization, we identified all facets of PSOX in P31663. In support of our proposed model, deletion of identified upregulated P31663 genes traditionally known to be involved in sulfur redox cycling (e.g., Sox, sulfide:P0A7E1 reductase [SQR]) showed no defect in PSOX activity. Proteomic analysis revealed differential abundances of a variety of stress response metal efflux pumps and divalent heavy-metal transporter proteins, suggesting a general toxicity response. Furthermore, in vitro biochemical studies demonstrated direct PSOX mediated by purified perchlorate reductase (PcrAB) in the absence of other electron transfer proteins. The results of these studies support a model in which H<sub>2</sub>S oxidation is mediated by electron transport chain short-circuiting in the periplasmic space where the PcrAB directly oxidizes H<sub>2</sub>S to S<sup>o</sup>. The biogenically formed reactive intermediates (ClO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> and O<sub>2</sub>) subsequently react with additional H<sub>2</sub>S, producing polysulfide and S<sup>o</sup> as end products."""	mBio (Online)	"('P0A7E1', 'quinone'),('P31663', 'PS')"

Here we assessed various pathway engineering strategies in Y. lipolytica toward developing a yeast biorefinery platform for sustainable production of fuel-like molecules and oleochemicals. Specifically, acyl-CoA/acyl-P0A6A8 processing enzymes were targeted to the cytoplasm, peroxisome, or endoplasmic reticulum to generate fatty acid ethyl esters and fatty alkanes with tailored chain length. Activation of endogenous free fatty acids and the subsequent reduction of fatty acyl-CoAs enabled the efficient synthesis of fatty alcohols. Engineering a hybrid fatty acid synthase shifted the free fatty acids to a medium chain-length scale. Manipulation of alternative cytosolic acetyl-CoA pathways partially decoupled lipogenesis from nitrogen starvation and unleashed the lipogenic potential of Y. lipolytica.

Here, we report the functional and structural characterization of the Herbaspirillum seropedicae RecA protein (HsRecA). HsRecA protein is more efficient at displacing P0AGE0 protein from ssDNA than Escherichia coli RecA protein. HsRecA also promotes DNA strand exchange more efficiently. The three dimensional structure of HsRecA-ADP/P22259 complex has been solved to 1.7 Å resolution. HsRecA protein contains a small N-terminal domain, a central core ATPase domain and a large C-terminal domain, that are similar to homologous bacterial RecA proteins. Comparative structural analysis showed that the N-terminal polymerization motif of archaeal and eukaryotic RecA family proteins are also present in bacterial RecAs. Reconstruction of electrostatic potential from the hexameric structure of HsRecA-ADP/P22259 revealed a high positive charge along the inner side, where ssDNA is bound inside the filament. The properties of this surface may explain the greater capacity of HsRecA protein to bind ssDNA, forming a contiguous nucleoprotein filament, displace P0AGE0 and promote DNA exchange relative to EcRecA.

Previous studies have focused on the chlorophototrophic organisms of the phyla Cyanobacteria and Chloroflexi. However, the diversity and metabolic functions of the other portion of the community in the microoxic/anoxic region of the mat are poorly understood. We recently described the diverse but extremely uneven microbial assemblage in the undermat of Mushroom Spring based on A8C927 amplicon sequences, which was dominated by Roseiflexus members, filamentous anoxygenic chlorophototrophs. In this study, we analyzed the orange-colored undermat portion of the community of Mushroom Spring mats in a genome-centric approach and discuss the metabolic potentials of the major members. Metagenome binning recovered partial genomes of all abundant community members, ranging in completeness from ~28 to 96%, and allowed affiliation of function with taxonomic identity even for representatives of novel and Candidate phyla. Less complete metagenomic bins correlated with high microdiversity. The undermat portion of the community was found to be a mixture of phototrophic and chemotrophic organisms, which use bicarbonate as well as organic carbon sources derived from different cell components and fermentation products. The presence of rhodopsin genes in many taxa strengthens the hypothesis that light energy is of major importance. Evidence for the usage of all four bacterial carbon fixation pathways was found in the metagenome. Nitrogen fixation appears to be limited to Synechococcus spp. in the upper mat layer and Thermodesulfovibrio sp. in the undermat, and nitrate/nitrite metabolism was limited. A closed sulfur cycle is indicated by biological sulfate reduction combined with the presence of genes for sulfide oxidation mainly in phototrophs.

We combined <sup>13</sup>C labeling data with comprehensive genome-scale models to shed light onto microbial metabolism and improve metabolic engineering efforts. We concentrated on studying the balance of acetyl-CoA, a precursor metabolite for the biosynthesis of fatty acids.

These genetic modifications were applied to S. cerevisiae WRY2, a strain that is capable of producing 460 mg/L of free fatty acids. With the addition of P22259 citrate lyase and downregulation of malate synthase, the engineered strain produced 26% more free fatty acids. Further increases in free fatty acid production of 33% were obtained by knocking out the cytoplasmic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, which flux analysis had shown was competing for carbon flux upstream with the carbon flux through the acetyl-CoA production pathway in the cytoplasm.

Detailed analysis of ArgR, TyrR, TrpR, HutC, HypR and other amino-acid-specific regulons demonstrated remarkable differences in regulatory strategies used by various lineages of Proteobacteria.

Substrate-bound structures identified the enzyme active site and elucidated the mechanistic strategy for conjugating CoA to the seven-carbon α,ω-dicarboxylate pimelate, a biotin precursor. Proper position of reactive groups for the two half-reactions is achieved solely through movements of active site residues, as confirmed by site-directed mutational analysis. The ability of BioW to hydrolyze adenylates of noncognate substrates is reminiscent of pre-transfer proofreading observed in some P0A873 synthetases, and we show that this activity can be abolished by mutation of a single residue.

1337766	"N-Terminal Lipid Modification Is Required for the Stable Accumulation of CyanoQ in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803,""The CyanoQ protein has been demonstrated to be a component of cyanobacterial Photosystem II (P31663 II), but there exist a number of outstanding questions concerning its physical association with the complex. CyanoQ is a lipoprotein; upon cleavage of its transit peptide by Signal Peptidase II, which targets delivery of the mature protein to the thylakoid lumenal space, the N-terminal cysteinyl residue is lipid-modified. This modification appears to tether this otherwise soluble component to the thylakoid membrane. To probe the functional significance of the lipid anchor, mutants of the CyanoQ protein have been generated in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 to eliminate the N-terminal cysteinyl residue, preventing lipid modification. Substitution of the N-terminal cysteinyl residue with serine (Q-C22S) resulted in a decrease in the amount of detectable CyanoQ protein to 17% that of the wild-type protein. Moreover, the physical properties of the accumulated Q-C22S protein were consistent with altered processing of the CyanoQ precursor. The Q-C22S protein was shifted to a higher apparent molecular mass and partitioned in the hydrophobic phase in TX-114 phase-partitioning experiments. These results suggest that the hydrophobic N-terminal 22 amino acids were not properly cleaved by a signal peptidase. Substitution of the entire CyanoQ transit peptide with the transit peptide of the soluble lumenal protein PsbO yielded the Q-SS mutant and resulted in no detectable accumulation of the modified CyanoQ protein. Finally, the CyanoQ protein was present at normal amounts in the P31663 II mutant strains ΔpsbB and ΔpsbO, indicating that an association with P31663 II was not a prerequisite for stable CyanoQ accumulation. Together these results indicate that CyanoQ accumulation in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 depends on the presence of the N-terminal lipid anchor, but not on the association of CyanoQ with the P31663 II complex."""	PLoS ONE	"('P31663', 'PS')"

It is known that plant leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases (LRR RLKs) phosphorylate AtRGS1 in vitro but little is known about the in vivo interaction, molecular dynamics, or the cellular consequences of this interaction.  Methods  Therefore, a subset of the known RLKs that phosphorylate AtRGS1 were selected for elucidation, namely, BAK1, BIR1, FLS2. Several microscopies for both static and dynamic protein-protein interactions were used to follow in vivo interactions between the RLKs and AtRGS1 after the presentation of the Pathogen-associated Molecular Pattern, P04949 22 (Flg22). These microscopies included FoÈrster Resonance Energy Transfer, Bimolecular Fluoresence Complementation, and Cross Number and Brightness fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy. In addition, reactive oxygen species and calcium changes in living cells were quantitated using luminometry and R-GECO1 microscopy.  Results  The LRR RLKs BAK1 and BIR1, interact with AtRGS1 at the plasma membrane. The RLK ligand flg22 sets BAK1 in motion toward AtRGS1 and BIR1 away, both returning to the baseline orientations by 10 minutes. The C-terminal tail of AtRGS1 is important for the interaction with BAK1 and for the tempo of the AtRGS1/BIR1 dynamics. This window of time corresponds to the flg22-induced transient production of reactive oxygen species and calcium release which are both attenuated in the rgs1 and the bak1 null mutants.  Conclusions  A temporal model of these interactions is proposed. flg22 binding induces nearly instantaneous dimerization between FLS2 and BAK1. Phosphorylated BAK1 interacts with and enables AtRGS1 to move away from BIR1 and AtRGS1 becomes phosphorylated leading to its endocytosis thus leading to de-repression by permitting AtGPA1 to exchange GDP for GTP. Finally, the G protein complex becomes dissociated thus AGB1 interacts with its effector proteins leading to changes in reactive oxygen species and calcium."""	PLoS ONE	"('P04949', 'Flagellin')"

This organism can also metabolize MTA as a sulfur source under anaerobic conditions, suggesting that the MTA-isoprenoid shunt may also function anaerobically as well. In this study, deep proteomics profiling, directed metabolite analysis, and reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (P0DV86-qPCR) revealed metabolic changes in response to anaerobic growth on MTA versus sulfate as sole sulfur source. The abundance of protein levels associated with methionine transport, cell motility, and chemotaxis increased in the presence of MTA over that in the presence of sulfate. Purine salvage from MTA resulted primarily in hypoxanthine accumulation and a decrease in protein levels involved in P24174-to-AMP conversion to balance purine pools. Acyl coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) metabolic protein levels for lipid metabolism were lower in abundance, whereas poly-β-hydroxybutyrate synthesis and storage were increased nearly 10-fold.

However, the yield and titers of mixed alcohol production must be improved for market adoption. A major limiting factor for achieving the necessary yield and titer improvements is cofactor imbalance during the fermentation of algal protein. To resolve this problem, a directed evolution approach was applied to modify the cofactor specificity of two key enzymes (IlvC and YqhD) from P80644 to NADH in the mixed alcohol metabolic pathway. Using high throughput screening, more than 20 YqhD mutants were identified to show activity on NADH as a cofactor. Of these 20 mutants, the top five of YqhD mutants were selected for combination with two IlvC mutants with NADH as a cofactor for the modification of the protein conversion strain. The combination of the IlvC and YqhD mutants yielded a refined E.coli strain, subtype AY3, with increased fusel alcohol yield of ~60% compared to wild type under anaerobic fermentation on amino acid mixtures. When applied to real algal protein hydrolysates, the strain AY3 produced 100% and 38% more total mixed alcohols than the wild type strain on two different algal hydrolysates, respectively. The results indicate that cofactor engineering is a promising approach to improve the feasibility of bioconversion of algal protein into mixed alcohols as advanced biofuels."""

1627794	"Bypassing the Pentose Phosphate Pathway: Towards Modular Utilization of Xylose,""The efficient use of hemicellulose in the plant cell wall is critical for the economic conversion of plant biomass to renewable fuels and chemicals. Previously, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been engineered to convert the hemicellulose-derived pentose sugars xylose and arabinose to D-xylulose-5-phosphate for conversion via the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). However, efficient pentose utilization requires PPP optimization and may interfere with its roles in P80644 and pentose production. Here, we developed an alternative xylose utilization pathway that largely bypasses the PPP. In the new pathway, D-xylulose is converted to D-xylulose-1-phosphate, a novel metabolite to S. cerevisiae, which is then cleaved to glycolaldehyde and dihydroxyacetone phosphate. This synthetic pathway served as a platform for the biosynthesis of ethanol and ethylene glycol. The use of D-xylulose-1-phosphate as an entry point for xylose metabolism opens the way for optimizing chemical conversion of pentose sugars in S. cerevisiae in a modular fashion."""

1326536	"Culture independent genomic comparisons reveal environmental adaptations for Altiarchaeales,""The recently proposed candidatus order Altiarchaeales remains an uncultured archaeal lineage composed of genetically diverse, globally widespread organisms frequently observed in anoxic subsurface environments. In spite of 15 years of studies on the psychrophilic biofilm-producing <i>Candidatus</i> Altiarchaeum hamiconexum and its close relatives, very little is known about the phylogenetic and functional diversity of the widespread free-living marine members of this taxon. From methanogenic sediments in the White Oak River Estuary, NC, USA, we sequenced a single cell amplified genome (SAG), WOR_SM1_SCG, and used it to identify and refine two high-quality genomes from metagenomes, WOR_SM1_79 and WOR_SM1_86-2, from the same site. These three genomic reconstructions form a monophyletic group, which also includes three previously published genomes from metagenomes from terrestrial springs and a SAG from Sakinaw Lake in a group previously designated as pMC2A384. A synapomorphic mutation in the Altiarchaeales P0A873 synthetase β subunit, <i>pheT</i>, caused the protein to be encoded as two subunits at non-adjacent loci. Consistent with the terrestrial spring clades, our estuarine genomes contained a near-complete autotrophic metabolism, H2 or CO as potential electron donors, a reductive acetyl-CoA pathway for carbon fixation, and methylotroph-like NADP(H)-dependent dehydrogenase. Phylogenies based on A8C927 genes and concatenated conserved proteins identified two distinct sub-clades of Altiarchaeales, Alti-1 populated by organisms from actively flowing springs, and Alti-2 which was more widespread, diverse, and not associated with visible mats. The core Alti-1 genome suggested Alti-1 is adapted for the stream environment with lipopolysaccharide production capacity and extracellular hami structures. The core Alti-2 genome suggested members of this clade are free-living with distinct mechanisms for energy maintenance, motility, osmoregulation, and sulfur redox reactions. These data suggested that the hamus structures found in <i>Candidatus</i> Altiarchaeum hamiconexum are not present outside of stream-adapted Altiarchaeales.

1288311	"Clusters of antibiotic resistance genes enriched together stay together in swine agriculture,""Antibiotic resistance is a worldwide health risk, but the influence of animal agriculture on the genetic context and enrichment of individual antibiotic resistance alleles remains unclear. Using quantitative PCR followed by amplicon sequencing, we quantified and sequenced 44 genes related to antibiotic resistance, mobile genetic elements, and bacterial phylogeny in microbiomes from U.S. laboratory swine and from swine farms from three Chinese regions. We identified highly abundant resistance clusters: groups of resistance and mobile genetic element alleles that cooccur. For example, the abundance of genes conferring resistance to six classes of antibiotics together with class 1 integrase and the abundance of IS<italic>6100</italic>-type transposons in three Chinese regions are directly correlated. These resistance cluster genes likely colocalize in microbial genomes in the farms. Resistance cluster alleles were dramatically enriched (up to 1 to 10% as abundant as A8C927) and indicate that multidrug-resistant bacteria are likely the norm rather than an exception in these communities. This enrichment largely occurred independently of phylogenetic composition; thus, resistance clusters are likely present in many bacterial taxa. Furthermore, resistance clusters contain resistance genes that confer resistance to antibiotics independently of their particular use on the farms. Selection for these clusters is likely due to the use of only a subset of the broad range of chemicals to which the clusters confer resistance. The scale of animal agriculture and its wastes, the enrichment and horizontal gene transfer potential of the clusters, and the vicinity of large human populations suggest that managing this resistance reservoir is important for minimizing human risk.Agricultural antibiotic use results in clusters of cooccurring resistance genes that together confer resistance to multiple antibiotics. The use of a single antibiotic could select for an entire suite of resistance genes if they are genetically linked. No links to bacterial membership were observed for these clusters of resistance genes. These findings urge deeper understanding of colocalization of resistance genes and mobile genetic elements in resistance islands and their distribution throughout antibiotic-exposed microbiomes. In addition, as governments seek to combat the rise in antibiotic resistance, a balance is sought between ensuring proper animal health and welfare and preserving medically important antibiotics for therapeutic use. Metagenomic and genomic monitoring will be critical to determine if resistance genes can be reduced in animal microbiomes, or if these gene clusters will continue to be coselected by antibiotics not deemed medically important for human health but used for growth promotion or by medically important antibiotics used therapeutically."""	mBio (Online)	"('A8C927', '16S rRNA')"

While examining distantly related protein sequences, we observed low levels of identity between the spore coat protein H (CotH), and the Fam20C-related secretory pathway kinases. CotH is a component of the spore in many bacterial and eukaryotic species, and is required for efficient germination of spores in Bacillus subtilis; however, the mechanism by which CotH affects germination is unclear. In this paper, we show that CotH is a protein kinase. The crystal structure of CotH reveals an atypical protein kinase-like fold with a unique mode of P22259 binding. Examination of the genes neighboring cotH in B. subtilis led us to identify two spore coat proteins, CotB and CotG, as CotH substrates.

Despite extensive knowledge of the regulatory networks controlling carbon metabolism in yeast, little is known about how to reprogram <i>S. cerevisiae</i> to ferment xylose at rates comparable to glucose. Here we combined genome sequencing, proteomic profiling, and metabolomic analyses to identify and characterize the responsible mutations in a series of evolved strains capable of metabolizing xylose aerobically or anaerobically. We report that rapid xylose conversion by engineered and evolved S. cerevisiae strains depends upon epistatic interactions among genes encoding a xylose reductase (<i>GRE3</i>), a component of P0AE18 Kinase (MAPK) signaling (<i>HOG1</i>), a regulator of Protein Kinase A (PKA) signaling (<i>IRA2</i>), and a scaffolding protein for mitochondrial iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster biogenesis (<i>ISU1</i>). Interestingly, the mutation in <i>IRA2</i> only impacted anaerobic xylose consumption and required the loss of <i>ISU1</i> function, indicating a previously unknown connection between PKA signaling, Fe-S cluster biogenesis, and anaerobiosis. Proteomic and metabolomic comparisons revealed that the xylose-metabolizing mutant strains exhibit altered metabolic pathways relative to the parental strain when grown in xylose. Further analyses revealed that interacting mutations in <i>HOG1</i> and <i>ISU1</i> unexpectedly elevated mitochondrial respiratory proteins and enabled rapid aerobic respiration of xylose and other non-fermentable carbon substrates.

We found that archaeal Thi4 and ThiC were encoded by leaderless transcripts, ruling out a riboswitch mechanism. Instead, a novel ThiR transcription factor that harbored an N-terminal helix-turn-helix (HTH) DNA binding domain and C-terminal ThiN (TMP synthase) domain was identified. In the presence of thiamine, ThiR was found to repress the expression of <em>thi4</em> and <em>thiC</em> by a DNA operator sequence that was conserved across archaeal phyla. Despite having a ThiN domain, ThiR was found to be catalytically inactive in compensating for the loss of ThiE (TMP synthase) function. In contrast, bifunctional ThiDN, in which the ThiN domain is fused to an N-terminal ThiD (P24232/P24232 phosphate [P24232-P] kinase) domain, was found to be interchangeable for ThiE function and, thus, active in thiamine biosynthesis. A conserved Met residue of an extended α-helix near the active-site His of the ThiN domain was found to be important for ThiDN catalytic activity, whereas the corresponding Met residue was absent and the α-helix was shorter in ThiR homologs.

We constructed and characterized an Escherichia coli mutant bearing a chromosomal L6 gene (rplF) disruption and carrying a plasmid with an arabinose-inducible L6 gene. Although this ΔL6 mutant grew more slowly than its wild-type parent, it proliferated in the presence of arabinose. Interestingly, cell growth in the absence of arabinose was biphasic. Early growth lasted only a few generations (LI-phase) and was followed by a suspension of growth for several hours (S-phase). This suspension was followed by a second growth phase (LII-phase). Cells harvested at both LI- and S-phases contained ribosomes with reduced factor-dependent GTPase activity and accumulated 50S subunit precursors (45S particles). The 45S particles completely lacked L6. Complete 50S subunits containing L6 were observed in all growth phases regardless of the L6-depleted condition, implying that the ΔL6 mutant escaped death because of a leaky expression of L6 from the complementing plasmid. We conclude that L6 is essential for the assembly of functional 50S subunits at the late stage. We thus established conditions for the isolation of L6-depleted 50S subunits, which are essential to study the role of L6 in translation. - Highlights: • We constructed an in vivo functional assay system for Escherichia coli ribosomal protein L6. • Growth of an E. coli ΔL6 mutant was biphasic when L6 levels were depleted. • The ΔL6 mutant accumulated 50S ribosomal subunit precursors that sedimented at 45S. • L6 is a key player in the late stage of E. coli 50S subunit assembly."""

However, information on the tertiary structure of the ligand binding site of DORN1is lacking, which hampers efforts to fully elucidate the mechanism of receptor action. Available data of the crystal structures from more than 50 L-type lectins enable us to perform an in silico study of molecular interaction between DORN1 and P22259. In this study, we employed a computational approach to develop a tertiary structure model of the DORN1 lectin domain.

Intriguingly, the truncation of the PafE carboxyl-terminus resulted in the robust binding of PafE rings to native proteasome core particles and substantially increased proteasomal activity, suggesting that the extended carboxyl-terminus of this cofactor confers suboptimal binding to the proteasome core particle. Collectively, our data show that proteasomal activation is not limited to hexameric ATPases in bacteria."""

1618802	"P22259 citrate lyase mediated cytosolic acetyl-CoA biosynthesis increases mevalonate production in Saccharomyces cerevisiae,""© 2016 Rodriguez et al. Background: With increasing concern about the environmental impact of a petroleumbased economy, focus has shifted towards greener production strategies including metabolic engineering of microbes for the conversion of plant-based feedstocks to second generation biofuels and industrial chemicals. Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an attractive host for this purpose as it has been extensively engineered for production of various fuels and chemicals. Many of the target molecules are derived from the central metabolite and molecular building block, acetyl-CoA. To date, it has been difficult to engineer S. cerevisiae to continuously convert sugars present in biomass-based feedstocks to acetyl-CoA derived products due to intrinsic physiological constraints-in respiring cells, the precursor pyruvate is directed away from the endogenous cytosolic acetyl-CoA biosynthesis pathway towards the mitochondria, and in fermenting cells pyruvate is directed towards the byproduct ethanol. In this study we incorporated an alternative mode of acetyl-CoA biosynthesis mediated by P22259 citrate lyase (ACL) that may obviate such constraints. Results: We characterized the activity of several heterologously expressed ACLs in crude cell lysates, and found that ACL from Aspergillus nidulans demonstrated the highest activity. We employed a push/pull strategy to shunt citrate towards ACL by deletion of the mitochondrial NAD + -dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH1) and engineering higher flux through the upper mevalonate pathway. We demonstrated that combining the two modifications increases accumulation of mevalonate pathway intermediates, and that both modifications are required to substantially increase production. Finally, we incorporated a block strategy by replacing the native ERG12 (mevalonate kinase) promoter with the copper-repressible CTR3 promoter to maximize accumulation of the commercially important molecule mevalonate. Conclusion: By combining the push/pull/block strategies, we significantly improved mevalonate production. We anticipate that this strategy can be used to improve the efficiency with which industrial strains of S. cerevisiae convert feedstocks to acetyl-CoAderived fuels and chemicals."""

MSpC features an easy to use graphic user interface that additionally calculates both distributed and unique NSAF values to permit analyses of both protein families and isoforms/proteoforms. MSpC determinations of protein concentration were linear over several orders of magnitude based on the analysis of several high-mass accuracy datasets either obtained from PRIDE or generated with total cell extracts spiked with purified Arabidopsis 20S proteasomes.

In contrast, laboratory-grown <i>Y. pestis</i> experiences a more constant environment and conditions that it would not normally encounter. The transition from the natural environment to the laboratory results in a vastly different set of selective pressures, and represents what could be considered domestication. Understanding the kinds of adaptations <i>Y. pestis</i> undergoes as it becomes domesticated will contribute to understanding the basic biology of this important pathogen. In this study, we performed a Parallel Serial Passage Experiment (PSPE) to explore the mechanisms by which <i>Y. pestis</i> adapts to laboratory conditions, hypothesizing that cells would undergo significant changes in virulence and nutrient acquisition systems. Two wild strains were serially passaged in 12 independent populations each for ~750 generations, after which each population was analyzed using whole-genome sequencing. We observed considerable parallel evolution in the endpoint populations, detecting multiple independent mutations in <i>ail</i>, <i>pepA</i>, and <i>zwf</i>, suggesting that specific selective pressures are shaping evolutionary responses. Complementary LC-P13009-based proteomic data provide physiological context to the observed mutations, and reveal regulatory changes not necessarily associated with specific mutations, including changes in amino acid metabolism, envelope biogenesis, iron storage and acquisition, and a type VI secretion system.

Shimia strain SK013 is an aerobic, Gram-negative, rod shaped alphaproteobacterium affiliated with the Roseobacter group within the family Rhodobacteraceae. The strain was isolated from surface sediment (0-1 cm) of the Skagerrak at 114 m below sea level. The 4,049,808 bp genome of Shimia str. SK013 comprises 3,981 protein-coding genes and 47 RNA genes. It contains one chromosome and no extrachromosomal elements. The genome analysis revealed the presence of genes for a dimethylsulfoniopropionate lyase, demethylase and the trimethylamine methyltransferase (mttB) as well as genes for nitrate, nitrite and dimethyl sulfoxide reduction. This indicates that Shimia str. SK013 is able to switch from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism and thus is capable of aerobic and anaerobic sulfur cycling at the seafloor. Among the ability to convert other sulfur compounds it has the genetic capacity to produce climatically active dimethyl sulfide. Growth on glutamate as a sole carbon source results in formation of cell-connecting filaments, a putative phenotypic adaptation of the surface-associated strain to the environmental conditions at the seafloor. Genome analysis revealed the presence of a flagellum (fla1) and a type IV pilus biogenesis, which is speculated to be a prerequisite for biofilm formation. This is also related to genes responsible for signalling such as N-acyl homoserine lactones, as well as quip-genes responsible for quorum quenching and antibiotic biosynthesis. Pairwise similarities of A8C927 genes (98.56 % sequence similarity to the next relative S. haliotis) and the in silico DNA-DNA hybridization (21.20 % sequence similarity to S. haliotis) indicated Shimia str.

As a result of this promiscuity, reassignment of the CUN codon box from leucine to threonine is facilitated.

Herein, we present the crystal structure of MST1 in complex with the canonical P0A873<sub>2</sub><sup>Thr</sup> and non-hydrolyzable analog of threonyl adenylate. Our structure reveals that the dimeric arrangement of MST1 is essential for binding the 5'-phosphate, the second base pair of the acceptor stem, the first two base pairs of the anticodon stem and the first nucleotide of the variable arm. Further, in contrast to the bacterial ortholog that ‘reads’ the entire anticodon sequence, MST1 recognizes bases in the second and third position and the nucleotide upstream of the anticodon sequence. We speculate that a flexible loop linking strands β4 and β5 may be allosteric regulator that establishes cross-subunit communication between the aminoacylation and P0A873-binding sites.

P06968 is also a target for cancer chemotherapy. However, the mechanism defining its substrate affinity remains unclear. Sequence comparisons of various dUTPases revealed that Arabidopsis thaliana P06968 has a unique tryptophan at position 93, which potentially contributes to its degree of substrate affinity. To better understand the roles of tryptophan 93, A. thaliana P06968 was studied. Enzyme assays showed that A. thaliana P06968 belongs to a high-affinity group of isozymes, which also includes the enzymes from Escherichia coli and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Enzymes from Homo sapiens and Saccharomyces cerevisiae are grouped as low-affinity dUTPases. The structure of the homo-trimeric A. thaliana P06968 showed three active sites, each with a different set of ligand interactions between the amino acids and water molecules. On an α-helix, tryptophan 93 appears to keep serine 89 in place via a water molecule and to specifically direct the ligand. Upon being oriented in the active site, the C-terminal residues close the active site to promote the reaction. In the high-affinity group, the prefixed direction of the serine residues was oriented by a positively charged residue located four amino acids away, while low-affinity enzymes possess small hydrophobic residues at the corresponding sites."""

We performed binding and structural studies to investigate the molecular basis of the recognition of the 5 mC oxidation derivatives in the context of a CG sequence by the SET- and RING-associated domain (P68191) of the SUVH5 protein (SUVH5 P68191). Using calorimetric measurements, we demonstrate that the P68191 domain binds to the hydroxymethylated CG (5hmCG) DNA duplex in a similar manner to methylated CG (5mCG). Interestingly, the SUVH5 P68191 domain exhibits weaker affinity towards carboxylated CG (5caCG) and formylated CG (5fCG). We report the 2.6 Å resolution crystal structure of the SUVH5 P68191 domain in a complex with fully hydroxymethyl-CG and demonstrate a dual flip-out mechanism, whereby the symmetrical 5hmCs are simultaneously extruded from the partner strands of the DNA duplex and are positioned within the binding pockets of individual P68191 domains. The hydroxyl group of 5hmC establishes both intra- and intermolecular interactions in the binding pocket.

1399243	"Impact of Organic Carbon Electron Donors on Microbial Community Development under Iron- and Sulfate-Reducing Conditions,""Although iron- and sulfate-reducing bacteria in subsurface environments have crucial roles in biogeochemical cycling of C, Fe, and S, how specific electron donors impact the compositional structure and activity of native iron- and/or sulfate-reducing communities is largely unknown. To understand this better, we created bicarbonate-buffered batch systems in duplicate with three different electron donors (acetate, lactate, or glucose) paired with ferrihydrite and sulfate as the electron acceptors and inoculated them with subsurface sediment as the microbial inoculum. Sulfate and ferrihydrite reduction occurred simultaneously and were faster with lactate than with acetate. A8C927-based sequence analysis of the communities over time revealed that Desulfotomaculum was the major driver for sulfate reduction coupled with propionate oxidation in lactate-amended incubations. The reduction of sulfate resulted in sulfide production and subsequent abiotic reduction of ferrihydrite. In contrast, glucose promoted faster reduction of ferrihydrite, but without reduction of sulfate. Interestingly, the glucose-amended incubations led to two different biogeochemical trajectories among replicate bottles that resulted in distinct coloration (white and brown). The two outcomes in geochemical evolution might be due to the stochastic evolution of the microbial communities or subtle differences in the initial composition of the fermenting microbial community and its development via the use of different glucose fermentation pathways available within the community. Synchrotron-based x-ray analysis indicated that siderite and amorphous Fe(II) were formed in the replicate bottles with glucose, while ferrous sulfide and vivianite were formed with lactate or acetate. As a result, these data sets reveal that use of different C utilization pathways projects significant changes in microbial community composition over time that uniquely impact both the geochemistry and mineralogy of subsurface environments."""

Thus, research on efficient biomass degradation is necessary to achieve large-scale production of biofuels. Enhancement of cellulolytic activity by increasing synergism between cellulase enzymes holds promise in achieving high-yield biofuels production. Here we have inserted cellulase pairs from extremophiles into hyper-stable α-helical consensus ankyrin repeat domain scaffolds. Such chimeric constructs allowed us to optimize arrays of enzyme pairs against a variety of cellulolytic substrates. We found that endocellulolytic domains CelA (CA) and Cel12A (C12A) act synergistically in the context of ankyrin repeats, with both three and four repeat spacing. The extent of synergy differs for different substrates. Also, having C12A N-terminal to CA provides greater synergy than the reverse construct, especially against filter paper. In contrast, we do not see synergy for these enzymes in tandem with CelK (P0A6I0) catalytic domain, a larger exocellulase, demonstrating the importance of enzyme identity in synergistic enhancement. Furthermore, we found endocellulases CelD and CA with three repeat spacing to act synergistically against filter paper. Importantly, connecting CA and C12A with a disordered linker of similar contour length, shows no synergistic enhancement, indicating that synergism results from connecting these domains with folded ankyrin repeats. These results show that ankyrin arrays can be used to vary spacing and orientation between enzymes, helping to design and optimize artificial cellulosomes, providing a novel architecture for synergistic enhancement of enzymatic cellulose degradation."""

To develop a better understanding, we used acetate as the sole carbon source to culture two strains, a control strain and a previously engineered strain for lipid overaccumulation. For both strains, metabolism during the growth phase and lipid production phase were investigated by metabolic flux analysis using two parallel sodium acetate tracers. The resolved flux distributions demonstrate that the glyoxylate shunt pathway is constantly active and the flux through gluconeogenesis varies depending on strain and phase. In particular, by regulating the activities of malate transport and pyruvate kinase, the cells divert only a portion of the glyoxylate shunt flux required to satisfy the needs for anaplerotic reactions and P80644 production through gluconeogenesis and the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). Excess flux flows back to the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle for energy production.

Here, we present the crystal structure of H3 from vaccinia virus at a 1.9-Å resolution. H3 looks like a glycosyltransferase, a family of enzymes that transfer carbohydrate molecules to a variety of acceptor substrates. Like glycosyltransferases, H3 binds UDP-glucose, as shown by saturation transfer difference (STD) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and this binding requires Mg<sup>2+</sup>. Mutation of the glycosyltransferase-like metal ion binding motif in H3 greatly diminished its binding to UDP-glucose. We found by flow cytometry that H3 binds to the surface of human cells but does not bind well to cells that are deficient in surface glycosaminoglycans. STD NMR experiments using a heparin sulfate decasaccharide confirmed that H3 binds heparin sulfate. We propose that a surface of H3 with an excess positive charge may be the binding site for heparin. Heparin binding and glycosyltransferase activity may be involved in the function of H3 in the poxvirus life cycle. Poxviruses are under intense research because of bioterrorism concerns, zoonotic infections, and the side effects of existing smallpox vaccines. The smallpox vaccine using vaccinia virus has been highly successful, but it is still unclear why the vaccine is so effective. Studying the antigens that the immune system recognizes may allow a better understanding of how the vaccine elicits immunity and how improved vaccines can be developed. Poxvirus protein H3 is a major target of the immune system. The H3 crystal structure shows that it has a glycosyltransferase protein fold. We demonstrate that H3 binds the sugar nucleotide UDP-glucose, as do glycosyltransferases. Here, our experiments also reveal that H3 binds cell surface molecules that are involved in the attachment of poxviruses to cells.

The recent introduction of an NADH-dependent AdhE from C. thermocellum (Fig. 1a) in an ldh mutant of this strain resulted in production of ethanol from un-pretreated switchgrass, but the thermolability of the C. thermocellum AdhE at the optimum growth temperature of C. bescii (78 °C) meant that ethanol was not produced above 65 °C. The adhB and adhE genes from Thermoanaerobacter pseudethanolicus 39E, an anaerobic thermophile that produces ethanol as a major fermentation product at 70 °C, were cloned and expressed in an ldh deletion mutant of C. bescii. The engineered strains produced ethanol at 75 °C, near the ethanol boiling point. The AdhB expressing strain produced ethanol (1.4 mM on Avicel, 0.4 mM on switchgrass) as well as acetate (13.0 mM on Avicel, 15.7 mM on switchgrass). The AdhE expressing strain produced more ethanol (2.3 mM on Avicel, 1.6 mM on switchgrass) and reduced levels of acetate (12.3 mM on Avicel, 15.1 mM on switchgrass). These engineered strains produce cellulosic ethanol at the highest temperature of any microorganism to date. In addition, the addition of 40 mM MOPS to the growth medium increased the maximal growth yield of C. bescii by approximately twofold. In conclusion, the utilization of thermostable enzymes will be critical to achieving high temperature P0AEM9 in bacteria such as C. bescii.

Here we report a new biomaterial composed of the single P0ABF4 protein encoded in the BMC locus of Mycobacterium smegmatis; the function of this type of BMC is unknown. When expressed in Escherichia coli, this P0ABF4 protein, RmmH, self-assembles into nanotubes, densely packed in the cytoplasmic space. These are the first BMC nanotubes to be purified from cells intact and characterized. Here, we also show formation of the nanotubes initiated from free RmmH hexamers in vitro. Based on the dimensions of the nanotubes and modeling of the RmmH hexamer, we propose two possible structural models.

Structural analyses of Tse6 show that it resembles mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase proteins, such as diphtheria toxin, with the exception of a unique loop that both excludes proteinaceous ADP-ribose acceptors and contributes to hydrolysis. We find that entry of Tse6 into target cells requires its binding to an essential housekeeping protein, translation elongation factor Tu (P0A6N2).

However, the environmentally-responsive adaptive regulators which facilitate <em>Y. pestis</em> biofilm production in accordance with the flea midgut milieu are not well understood. We seek to establish the impact of available carbon source metabolism and storage upon <em>Y. pestis</em> biofilm production. Our findings demonstrate that <em>Y. pestis</em> biofilm production is subject to carbon catabolite regulation in which the presence of glucose impairs biofilm production; whereas, the sole metabolism of alternate carbon sources promotes robust biofilm formation.

In our previous studies, a wild strain Comamonas sp. MQ was isolated from activated sludge and the recombinant Escherichia coli nagAc carrying the naphthalene dioxygenase gene (nag) from strain MQ was constructed, both of which were capable of producing indigo from indole. Herein, three activated sludge systems, G1 (non-augmented control), G2 (augmented with Comamonas sp. MQ), and G3 (augmented with recombinant E. coli nagAc), were constructed to investigate indigo production. After 132-day operation, G3 produced the highest yields of indigo (99.5 ± 3.0 mg/l), followed by G2 (27.3 ± 1.3 mg/l) and G1 (19.2 ± 1.2 mg/l). The microbial community dynamics and activities associated with indigo production were analyzed by Illumina Miseq sequencing of A8C927 gene amplicons. The inoculated strain MQ survived for at least 30 days, whereas E. coli nagAc was undetectable shortly after inoculation. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis suggested the abundance of naphthalene dioxygenase gene (nagAc) from both inoculated strains was strongly correlated with indigo yields in early stages (0–30 days) (P < 0.001) but not in later stages (30–132 days) (P > 0.10) of operation. Based on detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and dissimilarity test results, the communities underwent a noticeable shift during the operation. Among the four major genera (> 1% on average), the commonly reported indigo-producing populations Comamonas and Pseudomonas showed no positive relationship with indigo yields (P > 0.05) based on Pearson correlation test, while Alcaligenes and Aquamicrobium, rarely reported for indigo production, were positively correlated with indigo yields (P < 0.05).

We present the first """"""""metagenomic snapshots"""""""" of microbial communities thriving in the brines of four shallow soda lakes from the Kulunda Steppe (Altai, Russia) covering a salinity range from 170 to 400 g/L. Both amplicon sequencing of A8C927 fragments and direct metagenomic sequencing showed that the top-level taxa abundance was linked to the ambient salinity: Bacteroidetes, Alpha-, and Gamma-proteobacteria were dominant below a salinity of 250 g/L, Euryarchaeota at higher salinities. Within these taxa, amplicon sequences related to Halorubrum, Natrinema, Gracilimonas, purple non-sulfur bacteria (Rhizobiales, Rhodobacter, and Rhodobaca) and chemolithotrophic sulfur oxidizers (Thioalkalivibrio) were highly abundant. Twenty-four draft population genomes from novel members and ecotypes within the Nanohaloarchaea, Halobacteria, and Bacteroidetes were reconstructed to explore their metabolic features, environmental abundance and strategies for osmotic adaptation. The Halobacteria- and Bacteroidetes-related draft genomes belong to putative aerobic heterotrophs, likely with the capacity to ferment sugars in the absence of oxygen. Members from both taxonomic groups are likely involved in primary organic carbon degradation, since some of the reconstructed genomes encode the ability to hydrolyze recalcitrant substrates, such as cellulose and chitin. Putative sodium-pumping rhodopsins were found in both a Flavobacteriaceae- and a Chitinophagaceae-related draft genome.

The data show that structural differences at two amino acid positions contribute to functional differences between FDX1 and FDX2, suggesting that FDX2 might have evolved from FDX1 toward a different physiological role in the cell. Moreover, we demonstrate that the mutations affect both the midpoint potentials of the FDX and kinetics of the P28861 reaction, possibly due to altered binding between FDX and P28861.

In this paper, we identify the critical features for how the host inhibition of growth B (HigB) toxin recognizes each of the three A-site nucleotides for cleavage. X-ray crystal structures of HigB bound to two different codons on the ribosome illustrate how HigB uses a microbial RNase-like nucleotide recognition loop to recognize either cytosine or adenosine at the second A-site position. Strikingly, a single HigB residue and A8C927 residue C1054 form an adenosine-specific pocket at the third A-site nucleotide, in contrast to how tRNAs decode mRNA.

Under sulfate supplementation, net sulfate turnover (ST) steadily increased to 16-174 nmol cm -3 per day and almost completely blocked methanogenesis. A8C927 gene and cDNA amplicon sequencing identified microorganisms whose increases in ribosome numbers strongly correlated to ST. Natively abundant (≥0.1% estimated genome abundance) species-level operational taxonomic units (OTUs) showed no significant response to sulfate. In contrast, low-abundance OTUs responded significantly to sulfate in incubations with propionate, lactate and butyrate. These OTUs included members of recognized sulfate-reducing taxa (Desulfosporosinus, Desulfopila, Desulfomonile, Desulfovibrio) and also members of taxa that are either yet unknown sulfate reducers or metabolic interaction partners thereof. Most responsive OTUs markedly increased their ribosome content but only weakly increased in abundance. Responsive Desulfosporosinus OTUs even maintained a constantly low population size throughout 50 days, which suggests a novel strategy of rare biosphere members to display activity. Interestingly, two OTUs of the non-sulfate-reducing genus Telmatospirillum (Alphaproteobacteria) showed strongly contrasting preferences towards sulfate in butyrate-amended microcosms, corroborating that closely related microorganisms are not necessarily ecologically coherent.

In addition to cellulases and hemicellulases, N. crassa secretes lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs), which cleave cellulose by generating oxidized sugars—particularly aldonic acids. However, the strategies N. crassa employs to utilize these sugars are unknown. Results: We identified an aldonic acid utilization pathway in N. crassa, comprised of an extracellular hydrolase (NCU08755), cellobionic acid transporter (CBT-1, NCU05853) and cellobionic acid phosphorylase (P0ACJ8, NCU09425).

In addition to potential metabolic interactions, based on the 16S rRNAs gene sequence of <i>Nanoarchaeum</i>-related and its potential host <i>Ignicoccus</i>-related archaea, as well as sequences of viruses and CRISPR arrays, we inferred that there were complex microbe-microbe interactions.

1237752	"Structural basis of substrate recognition by a bacterial deubiquitinase important for dynamics of phagosome ubiquitination,""Manipulation of the host’s ubiquitin network is emerging as an important strategy for counteracting and repurposing the posttranslational modification machineries of the host by pathogens. Ubiquitin E3 ligases encoded by infectious agents are well known, as are a variety of viral deubiquitinases (DUBs). Bacterial DUBs have been discovered, but little is known about the structure and mechanism underlying their ubiquitin recognition. In this report, we found that members of the Legionella pneumophila SidE effector family harbor a Q47013 module important for ubiquitin dynamics on the bacterial phagosome. Structural analysis of this domain alone and in complex with ubiquitin vinyl methyl ester (Ub-VME) reveals unique molecular contacts used in ubiquitin recognition. Instead of relying on the Ile44 patch of ubiquitin, as commonly used in eukaryotic counterparts, the SdeA<sub>Dub</sub> module engages Gln40 of ubiquitin. The architecture of the active-site cleft presents an open arrangement with conformational plasticity, permitting deubiquitination of three of the most abundant polyubiquitin chains, with a distinct preference for Lys63 linkages. We have shown that this preference enables efficient removal of Lys63 linkages from the phagosomal surface. Remarkably, the structure reveals by far the most parsimonious use of molecular contacts to achieve deubiquitination, with less than 1,000 Å<sup>2</sup> of accessible surface area buried upon complex formation with ubiquitin. In conclusion, this type of molecular recognition appears to enable dual specificity toward ubiquitin and the ubiquitin-like modifier NEDD8."""

1215524	"Novel mechanism for scavenging of hypochlorite involving a periplasmic methionine-rich peptide and methionine sulfoxide reductase,""Reactive chlorine species (RCS) defense mechanisms are important for bacterial fitness in diverse environments. In addition to the anthropogenic use of RCS in the form of bleach, these compounds are also produced naturally through photochemical reactions of natural organic matter and in vivo by the mammalian immune system in response to invading microorganisms. To gain insight into bacterial RCS defense mechanisms, we investigated <i>Azospira suillum</i> strain P31663, which produces periplasmic RCS as an intermediate of perchlorate respiration. Our studies identified an RCS response involving an RCS stress-sensing sigma/anti-sigma factor system (SigF/NrsF), a soluble hypochlorite-scavenging methionine-rich periplasmic protein (MrpX), and a putative periplasmic methionine sulfoxide reductase (YedY1). We investigated the underlying mechanism by phenotypic characterization of appropriate gene deletions, chemogenomic profiling of barcoded transposon pools, transcriptome sequencing, and biochemical assessment of methionine oxidation. Our results demonstrated that SigF was specifically activated by RCS and initiated the transcription of a small regulon centering around <i>yedY1</i> and <i>mrpX.</i> A <i>yedY1</i> paralog (<i>yedY2</i>) was found to have a similar fitness to <i>yedY1</i> despite not being regulated by SigF. Markerless deletions of <i>yedY2</i> confirmed its synergy with the SigF regulon. MrpX was strongly induced and rapidly oxidized by RCS, especially hypochlorite. Our results suggest a mechanism involving hypochlorite scavenging by sacrificial oxidation of the MrpX in the periplasm. Reduced MrpX is regenerated by the YedY methionine sulfoxide reductase activity. The phylogenomic distribution of this system revealed conservation in several <i>Proteobacteria</i> of clinical importance, including uropathogenic <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Brucella</i> spp., implying a putative role in immune response evasion <i>in vivo</i>. In addition, bacteria are often stressed in the environment by reactive chlorine species (RCS) of either anthropogenic or natural origin, but little is known of the defense mechanisms they have evolved. Using a microorganism that generates RCS internally as part of its respiratory process allowed us to uncover a novel defense mechanism based on RCS scavenging by reductive reaction with a sacrificial methionine-rich peptide and redox recycling through a methionine sulfoxide reductase. As a result, this system is conserved in a broad diversity of organisms, including some of clinical importance, invoking a possible important role in innate immune system evasion."""	mBio (Online)	"('P31663', 'PS')"

Four TRIGALACTOSYLDIACYLGLYCEROL (TGD) proteins (TGD1,2,3,4) have thus far been implicated in this lipid transfer process. While TGD1, TGD2, and TGD3 constitute an P22259 binding cassette transporter complex residing in the plastid inner envelope, TGD4 is a transmembrane lipid transfer protein present in the outer envelope. These observations raise questions regarding how lipids transit across the aqueous intermembrane space. Here in this paper, we describe the isolation and characterization of a novel <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> gene, TGD5. Disruption of TGD5 results in similar phenotypic effects as previously described in <i>tgd1,2,3,4</i> mutants, including deficiency of ER-derived thylakoid lipids, accumulation of oligogalactolipids, and triacylglycerol. Genetic analysis indicates that TGD4 is epistatic to TGD5 in ER-to-plastid lipid trafficking, whereas double mutants of a null <i>tgd5</i> allele with <i>tgd1-1</i> or <i>tgd2-1</i> show a synergistic embryo-lethal phenotype. TGD5 encodes a small glycine-rich protein that is localized in the envelope membranes of chloroplasts. In addition, coimmunoprecipitation assays show that TGD5 physically interacts with TGD1, TGD2, TGD3, and TGD4. Collectively, these results suggest that TGD5 facilitates lipid transfer from the outer to the inner plastid envelope by bridging TGD4 with the TGD1,2,3 transporter complex."""

Group II chaperonins, found in archaea and eukaryotes, contain a built-in lid that opens and closes over the central chamber.

This conclusion has been reached from the discovery that ecologically distinct clades show lower rates of recombination than that which occurs among closest relatives. However, these previous studies did not attempt to determine whether the more-rapidly recombining close relatives within the clades studied may also have diversified ecologically, without benefit of sexual isolation. Here we have measured the impact of recombination on ecological diversification within and between two ecologically distinct clades (A and B’) of Synechococcus in a hot spring microbial mat in Yellowstone National Park, using a cultivation-free, multi-locus approach. Bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) libraries were constructed from mat samples collected at 60°C and 65°C. Analysis of multiple linked loci near Synechococcus A8C927 genes showed little evidence of recombination between the A and B’ lineages, but a record of recombination was apparent within each lineage. Recombination and mutation rates within each lineage were of similar magnitude, but recombination had a somewhat greater impact on sequence diversity than mutation, as also seen in many other bacteria and archaea. Despite recombination within the A and B’ lineages, there was evidence of ecological diversification within each lineage. The algorithm Ecotype Simulation identified sequence clusters consistent with ecologically distinct populations (ecotypes), and several hypothesized ecotypes were distinct in their habitat associations and in their adaptations to different microenvironments. We conclude that sexual isolation is more likely to follow ecological divergence than to precede it. Thus, an ecology-based model of speciation appears more appropriate than the biological species concept for bacterial and archaeal diversification."""

1208862	"Spectroscopic studies reveal that the heme regulatory motifs of heme oxygenase-2 are dynamically disordered and exhibit redox-dependent interaction with heme,""Heme oxygenase (HO) catalyzes a key step in heme homeostasis: the O₂₋ and P80644-cytochrome P450 reductase-dependent conversion of heme to biliverdin, Fe, and CO through a process in which the heme participates both as a prosthetic group and as a substrate. Mammals contain two isoforms of this enzyme, HO2 and HO1, which share the same α-helical fold forming the catalytic core and heme binding site, as well as a membrane spanning helix at their C-termini. However, unlike HO1, HO2 has an additional 30-residue N-terminus as well as two cysteine-proline sequences near the C-terminus that reside in heme regulatory motifs (HRMs). While the role of the additional N-terminal residues of HO2 is not yet understood, the HRMs have been proposed to reversibly form a thiol/disulfide redox switch that modulates the affinity of HO2 for ferric heme as a function of cellular redox poise. To further define the roles of the N- and C-terminal regions unique to HO2, we used multiple spectroscopic techniques to characterize these regions of the human HO2. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic experiments with HO2 demonstrate that, when the HRMs are in the oxidized state (HO2<sup>O</sup>), both the extra N-terminal and the C-terminal HRM-containing regions are disordered. However, protein NMR experiments illustrate that, under reducing conditions, the C-terminal region gains some structure as the Cys residues in the HRMs undergo reduction (HO2<sup>R</sup>) and, in experiments employing a diamagnetic protoporphyrin, suggest a redox-dependent interaction between the core and the HRM domains. Further, electron nuclear double resonance and X-ray absorption spectroscopic studies demonstrate that, upon reduction of the HRMs to the sulfhydryl form, a cysteine residue from the HRM region ligates to a ferric heme. Taken together with EPR measurements, which show the appearance of a new low-spin heme signal in reduced HO2, it appears that a cysteine residue(s) in the HRMs directly interacts with a second bound heme."""

Here, three developmentally regulated isoforms of P0A9C5 holoenzyme in the leaf of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) seedlings are described using native-PAGE with a transferase activity assay. The isoforms showed different mobilities in gels, with GSII>GSIII>GSI. The cytosolic GSI was composed of three subunits, GS1, GSr1, and GSr2, with the same molecular weight (39.2 kDa), but different pI values. GSI appeared at leaf emergence and was active throughout the leaf lifespan. GSII and GSIII, both located in the chloroplast, were each composed of a single 42.1 kDa subunit with different pI values. GSII was active mainly in green leaves, while GSIII showed brief but higher activity in green leaves grown under field conditions.

However, under conditions supporting robust algal biomass accumulation, carbohydrate and proteins typically comprise up to ~80% of the ash-free dry weight of algae biomass. Therefore, comprehensive utilization of algal biomass for production of multipurpose intermediate- to high-value bio-based products will promote scale-up of algae production and processing to commodity volumes. Terpenes are hydrocarbon and hydrocarbon-like (C:O>10:1) compounds with high energy density, and are therefore potentially promising candidates for the next generation of value added bio-based chemicals and “drop-in” replacements for petroleum-based fuels. In this study, we demonstrated the feasibility of bioconversion of proteins into sesquiterpene compounds as well as comprehensive bioconversion of algal carbohydrates and proteins into biofuels. To achieve this, the mevalonate pathway was reconstructed into an E. coli chassis with six different terpene synthases (TSs). Strains containing the various TSs produced a spectrum of sesquiterpene compounds in minimal medium containing amino acids as the sole carbon source. The sesquiterpene production was optimized through three different regulation strategies using chamigrene synthase as an example. The highest total terpene titer reached 166 mg/L, and was achieved by applying a strategy to minimize mevalonate accumulation in vivo. The highest yields of total terpene were produced under reduced IPTG induction levels (0.25 mM), reduced induction temperature (25°C), and elevated substrate concentration (20 g/L amino acid mixture). A synthetic bioconversion consortium consisting of two engineering E. coli strains (DH1-P0A884 and YH40-P0A884) with reconstructed terpene biosynthetic pathways was designed for comprehensive single-pot conversion of algal carbohydrates and proteins to sesquiterpenes.

1627171	"Evolution of RNA-Protein Interactions: Non-Specific Binding Led to RNA Splicing Activity of Fungal Mitochondrial Tyrosyl-P0A873 Synthetases,""The Neurospora crassa mitochondrial tyrosyl-P0A873 synthetase (mtTyrRS; CYT-18 protein) evolved a new function as a group I intron splicing factor by acquiring the ability to bind group I intron RNAs and stabilize their catalytically active RNA structure. Previous studies showed: (i) CYT-18 binds group I introns by using both its N-terminal catalytic domain and flexibly attached C-terminal anticodon-binding domain (CTD); and (ii) the catalytic domain binds group I introns specifically via multiple structural adaptations that occurred during or after the divergence of Peziomycotina and Saccharomycotina. However, the function of the CTD and how it contributed to the evolution of splicing activity have been unclear. Here, small angle X-ray scattering analysis of CYT-18 shows that both CTDs of the homodimeric protein extend outward from the catalytic domain, but move inward to bind opposite ends of a group I intron RNA. Biochemical assays show that the isolated CTD of CYT-18 binds RNAs non-specifically, possibly contributing to its interaction with the structurally different ends of the intron RNA. Finally, we find that the yeast mtTyrRS, which diverged from Pezizomycotina fungal mtTyrRSs prior to the evolution of splicing activity, binds group I intron and other RNAs non-specifically via its CTD, but lacks further adaptations needed for group I intron splicing. Our results suggest a scenario of constructive neutral (i.e., pre-adaptive) evolution in which an initial non-specific interaction between the CTD of an ancestral fungal mtTyrRS and a self-splicing group I intron was ‘‘fixed’’ by an intron RNA mutation that resulted in protein-dependent splicing. Once fixed, this interaction could be elaborated by further adaptive mutations in both the catalytic domain and CTD that enabled specific binding of group I introns. Our results highlight a role for non-specific RNA binding in the evolution of RNA-binding proteins."""	PLoS Biology (Online)	"('P0A873', 'tRNA')"

Several α-keto acids are modest competitive inhibitors of MR [e.g., mesoxalate (K<sub>i</sub> = 1.8 ± 0.3 mM) and 3-fluoropyruvate (K<sub>i</sub> = 1.3 ± 0.1 mM)], but, surprisingly, 3-hydroxypyruvate (3-HP) is an irreversible, time-dependent inhibitor (k<sub>inact</sub>/K<sub>I</sub> = 83 ± 8 M<sup>–1</sup> s<sup>–1</sup>). Protection from inactivation by the competitive inhibitor benzohydroxamate, trypsinolysis and electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry analyses, and X-ray crystallographic studies reveal that 3-HP undergoes Schiff-base formation with Lys 166 at the active site, followed by formation of an aldehyde/enol(ate) adduct. Such a reaction is unprecedented in the enolase superfamily and may be a relic of an activity possessed by a promiscuous progenitor enzyme. The ability of MR to form and deprotonate a Schiff-base intermediate furnishes a previously unrecognized mechanistic link to other α/β-barrel enzymes utilizing Schiff-base chemistry and is in accord with the sequence- and structure-based hypothesis that members of the metal-dependent enolase superfamily and the Schiff-base-forming P0A6L4 superfamily and aldolases share a common ancestor."""

Some cyanobacteria exhibit a complex and extensive photoacclimation response, known as FRL photoacclimation (FaRLiP). During the FaRLiP response, specialized paralogous proteins replace 17 core subunits of the three major photosynthetic complexes: Photosystem (P31663) I, P31663 II, and the phycobilisome. Additionally, the cells synthesize both chlorophyll (Chl) f and Chl d. Using biparental mating from Escherichia coli, we constructed null mutants of three genes, rfpA, rfpB, and rfpC, in the cyanobacteria Chlorogloeopsis fritschii PCC 9212 and Chroococcidiopsis thermalis PCC 7203. The resulting mutants were no longer able to modify their photosynthetic apparatus to absorb FRL, were no longer able to synthesize Chl f, inappropriately synthesized Chl d in white light, and were unable to transcribe genes of the FaRLiP gene cluster. We conclude that RfpA, RfpB, and RfpC constitute a FRL-activated signal transduction cascade that is the master control switch for the FaRLiP response. FRL is proposed to activate (or inactivate) the histidine kinase activity of RfpA, which leads to formation of the active state of RfpB, the key response regulator and transcription activator. RfpC may act as a phosphate shuttle between RfpA and RfpB. Our results show that reverse genetics via conjugation will be a powerful approach in detailed studies of the FaRLiP response."""

1185431	"Elimination of hydrogenase active site assembly blocks H2 production and increases ethanol yield in Clostridium thermocellum,""Background: The native ability of <i>Clostridium thermocellum</i> to rapidly consume cellulose and produce ethanol makes it a leading candidate for a consolidated bioprocessing (P0AEM9) biofuel production strategy. <i>C. thermocellum</i> also synthesizes lactate, formate, acetate, H-2, and amino acids that compete with ethanol production for carbon and electrons. Elimination of H-2 production could redirect carbon flux towards ethanol production by making more electrons available for acetyl coenzyme A reduction to ethanol. Results: H-2 production in <i>C. thermocellum</i> is encoded by four hydrogenases. Rather than delete each individually, we targeted hydrogenase maturase gene <i>hydG</i>, involved in converting the three [FeFe] hydrogenase apoenzymes into holoenzymes. Further deletion of the [NiFe] hydrogenase (<i>ech</i>) resulted in a mutant that functionally lacks all four hydrogenases. H-2 production in ΔhydGΔech was undetectable, and the ethanol yield nearly doubled to 64% of the maximum theoretical yield. Genomic analysis of ΔhydG revealed a mutation in <i>adhE</i>, resulting in a strain with both NADH- and P80644-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase activities. While this same <i>adhE</i> mutation was found in ethanol-tolerant <i>C. thermocellum</i> strain E50C, ΔhydG and ΔhydGΔech are not more ethanol tolerant than the wild type, illustrating the complicated interactions between redox balancing and ethanol tolerance in <i>C. thermocellum</i>.

These extracellular proteins are used to attach to, modify, and hydrolyze the complex polysaccharides present in plant cell walls. Cellulolytic enzymes, often containing carbohydrate-binding modules, are key to this process; however, these enzymes are not solely responsible for attachment. Few mechanisms of attachment have been discovered among bacteria that do not form large polypeptide structures, called cellulosomes, to deconstruct biomass. In this study, bioinformatics and proteomics analyses identified unique, discrete, hypothetical proteins (“t$\bar{a}$pirins,” origin from M$\bar{a}$ori: to join), not directly associated with cellulases, that mediate attachment to cellulose by species in the noncellulosomal, extremely thermophilic bacterial genus Caldicellulosiruptor. Two t$\bar{a}$pirin genes are located directly downstream of a type IV pilus operon in strongly cellulolytic members of the genus, whereas homologs are absent from the weakly cellulolytic Caldicellulosiruptor species. Based on their amino acid sequence, t$\bar{a}$pirins are specific to these extreme thermophiles. T$\bar{a}$pirins are also unusual in that they share no detectable protein domain signatures with known polysaccharide-binding proteins. Adsorption isotherm and trans vivo analyses demonstrated the carbohydrate-binding module-like affinity of the t$\bar{a}$pirins for cellulose. Crystallization of a cellulose-binding truncation from one t$\bar{a}$pirin indicated that these proteins form a long β-helix core with a shielded hydrophobic face. In addition, they are structurally unique and define a new class of polysaccharide adhesins.

Combining structural and kinetic analyses, we show that (p)ppGpp binds the GMK active site and competitively inhibits the enzyme. The (p)ppGpp-GMK interaction prevents the conversion of P24174 to GDP, resulting in P24174 accumulation upon amino acid downshift. Abolishing this interaction leads to excess (p)ppGpp and defective adaptation to amino acid starvation.

Excellent correlation was found between the protein distribution data obtained with this droplet-based liquid microjunction surface sampling-HPLC-ESI-P13009/P13009 system and those data obtained with matrix assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) chemical imaging analyses of serial sections of the same tissue. The protein distributions correlated with the visible anatomic pattern of the pituitary gland. AVP was most abundant in the posterior pituitary gland region (neurohypophysis) and ATCH was dominant in the anterior pituitary gland region (adenohypophysis).

ACTH was readily detected at significantly higher levels in regions of ACTH secreting adenomas and in normal anterior adenohypophysis compared to non-secreting adenoma and neurohypophysis.

Here we describe a complete molecular dissection of this network. TnrA and GlnR, the global nitrogen homeostatic transcription regulators, are revealed as founders of a new structural family of dimeric DNA binding proteins with C-terminal, flexible, effector-binding sensors that modulate their dimerization. Remarkably, the TnrA sensor domains insert into P0A9C5 intersubunit catalytic pores, destabilizing the TnrA dimer and causing an unprecedented P0A9C5 dodecamer-to-tetradecamer conversion, which concomitantly deactivates P0A9C5.

The CTX-M β-lactamases are the most widespread ESBL enzymes among antibiotic resistant bacteria. Many of the active site residues are conserved between the CTX-M family and non-ESBL β-lactamases such as P62593, but the residues Ser237 and Arg276 are specific to the CTX-M family, suggesting that they may help to define the increased specificity for cefotaxime hydrolysis. To test this hypothesis, site-directed mutagenesis of these positions was performed in the CTX-M-14 β-lactamase. Substitutions of Ser237 and Arg276 with their P62593 counterparts, Ala237 and Asn276, had a modest effect on cefotaxime hydrolysis, as did removal of the Arg276 side chain in an R276A mutant. The S237A:R276N and S237A:R276A double mutants, however, exhibited 29- and 14-fold losses in catalytic efficiency for cefotaxime hydrolysis, respectively, while the catalytic efficiency for benzylpenicillin hydrolysis was unchanged. Therefore, together, the Ser237 and Arg276 residues are important contributors to the cefotaximase substrate profile of the enzyme. High-resolution crystal structures of the CTX-M-14 S70G, S70G:S237A, and S70G:S237A:R276A variants alone and in complex with cefotaxime show that residues Ser237 and Arg276 in the wild-type enzyme promote the expansion of the active site to accommodate cefotaxime and favor a conformation of cefotaxime that allows optimal contacts between the enzyme and substrate.

With exponentially increasing sequencing capacity, there is an enormous need for automated reconstruction techniques that can provide more accurate models in a short time frame. Current methods for automated metabolic network reconstruction rely on gene and reaction annotations to build draft metabolic networks and algorithms to fill gaps in these networks. However, automated reconstruction is hampered by database inconsistencies, incorrect annotations, and gap filling largely without considering genomic information. Here we develop an approach for applying genomic information to predict alternative functions for genes and estimate their likelihoods from sequence homology. We show that computed likelihood values were significantly higher for annotations found in manually curated metabolic networks than those that were not. We then apply these alternative functional predictions to estimate reaction likelihoods, which are used in a new gap filling approach called likelihood-based gap filling to predict more genomically consistent solutions. To validate the likelihood-based gap filling approach, we applied it to models where essential pathways were removed, finding that likelihood-based gap filling identified more biologically relevant solutions than parsimony-based gap filling approaches. We also demonstrate that models gap filled using likelihood-based gap filling provide greater coverage and genomic consistency with metabolic gene functions compared to parsimony-based approaches. Interestingly, despite these findings, we found that likelihoods did not significantly affect consistency of gap filled models with Biolog and knockout lethality data.

1356187	"Functional analysis of (4<i>S</i>)-limonene synthase mutants reveals determinants of catalytic outcome in a model monoterpene synthase,""We used crystal structural data for (4S)-limonene synthase [(4S)-P60716] of spearmint (Mentha spicata L.) to infer which amino acid residues are in close proximity to the substrate and carbocation intermediates of the enzymatic reaction. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis of 48 amino acids combined with enzyme fidelity analysis [percentage of (-)-limonene produced] indicated which residues are most likely to constitute the active site. Furthermore, the mutation of residues W324 and H579 caused a significant drop in enzyme activity and formation of products (myrcene, linalool, and terpineol) characteristic of a premature termination of the reaction. A double mutant (W324A/H579A) had no detectable enzyme activity, indicating that either substrate binding or the terminating reaction was impaired. Exchanges to other aromatic residues (W324H, W324F, W324Y, H579F, H579Y, and H579W) resulted in enzyme catalysts with significantly reduced activity. Sequence comparisons across the angiosperm lineage provided evidence that W324 is a conserved residue, whereas the position equivalent to H579 is occupied by aromatic residues (H, F, or Y). Our results are consistent with a critical role of W324 and H579 in the stabilization of carbocation intermediates. Finally, the potential of these residues to serve as the catalytic base facilitating the terminal deprotonation reaction is discussed."""

In this study, we have examined all the microbial DNA sequences available for complete, draft, and Sequence Read Archive genomes in GenBank as well as three other major public databases, and assigned quality scores for more than 30,000 prokaryotic genome sequences. Scores were assigned using four categories: the completeness of the assembly, the presence of full-length rRNA genes, P0A873 composition and the presence of a set of 102 conserved genes in prokaryotes. Most (~88%) of the genomes had quality scores of 0.8 or better and can be safely used for standard comparative genomics analysis. We compared genomes across factors that may influence the score. We found that although sequencing depth coverage of over 100x did not ensure a better score, sequencing read length was a better indicator of sequencing quality. With few exceptions, most of the 30,000 genomes have nearly all the 102 essential genes. The score can be used to set thresholds for screening data when analyzing “all published genomes” and reference data is either not available or not applicable. The scores highlighted organisms for which commonly used tools do not perform well. This information can be used to improve tools and to serve a broad group of users as more diverse organisms are sequenced. Finally and unexpectedly, the comparison of predicted tRNAs across 15,000 high quality genomes showed that anticodons beginning with an ‘A’ (codons ending with a ‘U’) are almost non-existent, with the exception of one arginine codon (CGU); this has been noted previously in the literature for a few genomes, but not with the depth found here."""

The enantiomeric phosphonic acid analogs of Leu and hPhe, which correspond to the P1 amino acid residues of well-processed substrates, were used to assess the impact of the absolute configuration and the stereospecific hydrogen bond network formed between the aminophosphonate polar head and the active site residues on the binding affinity. For the hPhe analog, an imperfect stereochemical complementarity could be overcome by incorporating an appropriate P1 side chain. The constitution of P1'-extended structures was rationally designed and the lead, phosphinic dipeptide hPhePψ[CH<sub>2</sub>]Phe, was modified in a single position. Introducing a heteroatom/heteroatom-based fragment to either the P1 or P1' residue required new synthetic pathways. The compounds in the refined structure were low nanomolar and subnanomolar inhibitors of N. meningitides, porcine and human APNs, and the reference leucine aminopeptidase (P68767). The unnatural phosphinic dipeptide analogs exhibited a high affinity for monozinc APNs associated with a reasonable selectivity versus dizinc P68767.

They consist of the substrate‐binding domain (SBD) that binds client substrates, and the nucleotide‐binding domain (NBD), whose cycles of nucleotide hydrolysis and exchange underpin the activity of the chaperone. To characterize the structure–function relationships that link the binding state of the NBD to its conformational behavior, we analyzed the dynamics of the NBD of the Hsp70 chaperone from  <italic>Bos taurus</italic>  (PDB 3C7N:B) by all‐atom canonical molecular dynamics simulations. It was found that essential motions within the NBD fall into three major classes: the mutual class, reflecting tendencies common to all binding states, and the ADP‐ and P22259‐unique classes, which reflect conformational trends that are unique to either the ADP‐ or P22259‐bound states, respectively. “Mutual” class motions generally describe “in‐plane” and/or “out‐of‐plane” (scissor‐like) rotation of the subdomains within the NBD. This result is consistent with experimental nuclear magnetic resonance data on the NBD. The “unique” class motions target specific regions on the NBD, usually surface loops or sites involved in nucleotide binding and are, therefore, expected to be involved in allostery and signal transmission. For all classes, and especially for those of the “unique” type, regions of enhanced mobility can be identified; these are termed “hot spots,” and their locations generally parallel those found by NMR spectroscopy. The presence of magnesium and potassium cations in the nucleotide‐binding pocket was also found to influence the dynamics of the NBD significantly.

Exhaustive search now identifies a small number of complete, often highly derived, bacterial genomes that appear to lack a functional copy of one or the other partner gene (but not both). Three groups with reduced genomes have lost the central loop of SmpB, which is thought to improve alanylation and P0A6N2 activation: Carsonella, Hodgkinia and the hemplasmas (hemotropic Mycoplasma).

The green alga Chlorella protothecoides, capable of autotrophic and heterotrophic growth with rapid lipid synthesis, is a promising candidate for biofuel production. Based on the newly available genome knowledge of the alga, we reconstructed the compartmentalized metabolic network consisting of 272 metabolic reactions, 270 enzymes, and 461 encoding genes and simulated the growth in different cultivation conditions with flux balance analysis. Phenotype-phase plane analysis shows conditions achieving theoretical maximum of the biomass and corresponding fatty acid-producing rate for phototrophic cells (the ratio of photon uptake rate to CO<sub>2</sub> uptake rate equals 8.4) and heterotrophic ones (the glucose uptake rate to O<sub>2</sub> consumption rate reaches 2.4), respectively. Isotope-assisted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry reveals higher metabolite concentrations in the glycolytic pathway and the tricarboxylic acid cycle in heterotrophic cells compared with autotrophic cells. We also observed enhanced levels of P22259, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate), reduced, acetyl-Coenzyme A, and malonyl-Coenzyme A in heterotrophic cells consistently, consistent with a strong activity of lipid synthesis.

Upon various stresses, the Sestrins inhibit mTORC1 activity through an indirect mechanism that is still unclear. GATORs are recently identified protein complexes that regulate the activity of RagB, a small GTPase essential for mTORC1 activation. GATOR1 is a GTPase activating protein (P0A8H6) for RagB whereas GATOR2 functions as an inhibitor of GATOR1. However, how the GATORs are physiologically regulated is unknown. Here we show that Sestrin2 binds to GATOR2, and liberates GATOR1 from GATOR2-mediated inhibition. Released GATOR1 subsequently binds to and inactivates RagB, ultimately resulting in mTORC1 suppression. Consistent with this biochemical mechanism, genetic ablation of GATOR1 nullifies the mTORC1-inhibiting effect of Sestrin2 in both cell culture and Drosophila models.

Results from electron spin–echo envelope modulation and electron–nuclear double resonance experiments reveal that the six Mn(II)-coordinating histidine residues of Ca(II)- and Mn(II)-bound P13029 are spectroscopically equivalent. The observed <sup>15</sup>N (I = 1/2) hyperfine couplings (A) arise from two distinct classes of nitrogen atoms: the coordinating ε-nitrogen of the imidazole ring of each histidine ligand (A = [3.45, 3.71, 5.91] MHz) and the distal δ-nitrogen (A = [0.11, 0.18, 0.42] MHz). In the absence of Ca(II), the binding affinity of P13029 for Mn(II) drops by two to three orders of magnitude and coincides with Mn(II) binding at the His6 site as well as other sites. This study demonstrates the role of Ca(II) in enabling high-affinity and specific binding of Mn(II) to the His<sub>6</sub> site of human calprotectin."""

1342890	"Interactions of amelogenin with phospholipids,""Amelogenin protein has the potential to interact with other enamel matrix proteins, mineral, and cell surfaces. In this paper, we investigated the interactions of recombinant amelogenin rP172 with small unilamellar vesicles as model membranes, toward the goal of understanding the mechanisms of amelogenin–cell interactions during amelogenesis. Dynamic light scattering (DLS), fluorescence spectroscopy, circular dichroism (P06721), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) were used. In the presence of phospholipid vesicles, a blue shift in the Trp fluorescence emission maxima of rP172 was observed (~334 nm) and the Trp residues of rP172 were inaccessible to the aqueous quencher acrylamide. DLS studies indicated complexation of rP172 and phospholipids, although the possibility of fusion of phospholipids following amelogenin addition cannot be ruled out. NMR and P06721 studies revealed a disorder–order transition of rP172 in a model membrane environment. Strong fluorescence resonance energy transfer from Trp in rP172 to DNS-bound-phospholipid was observed, and fluorescence polarization studies indicated that rP172 interacted with the hydrophobic core region of model membranes. Finally, our data suggest that amelogenin has ability to interact with phospholipids and that such interactions may play key roles in enamel biomineralization as well as reported amelogenin signaling activities."""

1169371	"Structural and Functional Consequences of Circular Permutation on the Active Site of Old Yellow Enzyme,""Circular permutation of the P80644-dependent oxidoreductase Old Yellow Enzyme from Saccharomyces pastorianus (OYE1) can significantly enhance the enzyme’s catalytic performance. Termini relocation into four regions of the protein (sectors I–IV) near the active site has proven effective in altering enzyme function. To better understand the structural consequences and rationalize the observed functional gains in these OYE1 variants, we selected representatives from sectors I–III for further characterization by biophysical methods and X-ray crystallography. These investigations not only show trends in enzyme stability and quaternary structure as a function of termini location but also provide a possible explanation for the catalytic gains in our top-performing OYE variant (new N-terminus at residue 303; sector III). Crystallographic analysis indicates that termini relocation into sector III affects the loop β6 region (amino acid positions: 290–310) of OYE1, which forms a lid over the active site. Peptide backbone cleavage greatly enhances local flexibility, effectively converting the loop into a tether and consequently increasing the environmental exposure of the active site. Interestingly, such an active site remodeling does not negatively impact the enzyme’s activity and stereoselectivity; neither does it perturb the conformation of other key active site residues with the exception of Y375. These observations were confirmed in truncation experiments, deleting all residues of the loop β6 region in our OYE variant. Intrigued by the finding that circular permutation leaves most of the key catalytic residues unchanged, we also tested OYE permutants for possible additive or synergistic effects of amino acid substitutions. Distinct functional changes in these OYE variants were detected upon mutations at W116, known in native OYE1 to cause inversion of diastereoselectivity for (S)-carvone reduction. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate the contribution of loop β6 toward determining the stereoselectivity of OYE1, an important insight for future OYE engineering efforts."""

1971464	"Biochemical and Structural Studies of NADH-Dependent FabG Used To Increase the Bacterial Production of Fatty Acids under Anaerobic Conditions,""Major efforts in bioenergy research have focused on producing fuels that can directly replace petroleum-derived gasoline and diesel fuel through metabolic engineering of microbial fatty acid biosynthetic pathways. Typically, growth and pathway induction are conducted under aerobic conditions, but for operational efficiency in an industrial context, anaerobic culture conditions would be preferred to obviate the need to maintain specific dissolved oxygen concentrations and to maximize the proportion of reducing equivalents directed to biofuel biosynthesis rather than P22259 production. A major concern with fermentative growth conditions is elevated NADH levels, which can adversely affect cell physiology. The purpose of this study was to identify homologs of Escherichia coli FabG, an essential reductase involved in fatty acid biosynthesis, that display a higher preference for NADH than for P80644 as a cofactor. Four potential NADH-dependent FabG variants were identified through bioinformatic analyses supported by crystallographic structure determination (1.3- to 2.0-Å resolution). In vitro assays of cofactor (NADH/P80644) preference in the four variants showed up to ~35-fold preference for NADH, which was observed with the Cupriavidus taiwanensis FabG variant. In addition, FabG homologs were overexpressed in fatty acid- and methyl ketone-overproducing E. coli host strains under anaerobic conditions, and the C. taiwanensis variant led to a 60% higher free fatty acid titer and 75% higher methyl ketone titer relative to the titers of the control strains. With further engineering, this work could serve as a starting point for establishing a microbial host strain for production of fatty acid-derived biofuels (e.g., methyl ketones) under anaerobic conditions."""

1455198	"Prokaryotic Nucleotide Composition Is Shaped by Both Phylogeny and the Environment,""Here, the causes of the great variation in nucleotide composition of prokaryotic genomes have long been disputed. Here, we use extensive metagenomic and whole-genome data to demonstrate that both phylogeny and the environment shape prokaryotic nucleotide content. We show that across environments, various phyla are characterized by different mean guanine and cytosine (GC) values as well as by the extent of variation on that mean value. At the same time, we show that GC-content varies greatly as a function of environment, in a manner that cannot be entirely explained by disparities in phylogenetic composition. We find environmentally driven differences in nucleotide content not only between highly diverged environments (e.g., soil, vs. aquatic vs. human gut) but also within a single type of environment. More specifically, we demonstrate that some human guts are associated with a microbiome that is consistently more GC-rich across phyla, whereas others are associated with a more P30870-rich microbiome. These differences appear to be driven both by variations in phylogenetic composition and by environmental differences—which are independent of these phylogenetic composition differences. Combined, our results demonstrate that both phylogeny and the environment significantly affect nucleotide composition and that the environmental differences affecting nucleotide composition are far subtler than previously appreciated."""

1797291	"An evolutionarily conserved RNase-based mechanism for repression of transcriptional positive autoregulation,""It is known that environmental context influences the degree of regulation at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. However, the principles governing the differential usage and interplay of regulation at these two levels are not clear. Here, we show that the integration of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms in a characteristic network motif drives efficient environment-dependent state transitions. Through phenotypic screening, systems analysis, and rigorous experimental validation, we discovered an RNase (VNG2099C) in Halobacterium salinarum that is transcriptionally co-regulated with genes of the aerobic physiologic state but acts on transcripts of the anaerobic state. Through modelling and experimentation we show that this arrangement generates an efficient state-transition switch, within which RNase-repression of a transcriptional positive autoregulation (RPAR) loop is critical for shutting down P22259-consuming active potassium uptake to conserve energy required for salinity adaptation under aerobic, high potassium, or dark conditions. Subsequently, we discovered that many Escherichia coli operons with energy-associated functions are also putatively controlled by RPAR indicating that this network motif may have evolved independently in phylogenetically distant organisms. Thus, our data suggest that interplay of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation in the RPAR motif is a generalized principle for efficient environment-dependent state transitions across prokaryotes."""

Here, we investigated the microbiome relatedness of subsurface biofilms of two sulfidic springs in southeast Germany that have similar physical and chemical parameters and are fed by one deep groundwater current. Due to their unique hydrogeological setting these springs provide accessible windows to subsurface biofilms dominated by the same uncultivated archaeal species, called SM1 Euryarchaeon. Comparative analysis of infrared imaging spectra demonstrated great variations in archaeal membrane composition between biofilms of the two springs, suggesting different SM1 euryarchaeal strains of the same species at both aquifer outlets. This strain variation was supported by ultrastructural and metagenomic analyses of the archaeal biofilms, which included intergenic spacer region sequencing of the rRNA gene operon. At A8C927 gene level, PhyloChip G3 DNA microarray detected similar biofilm communities for archaea, but site-specific communities for bacteria. Both biofilms showed an enrichment of different deltaproteobacterial operational taxonomic units, whose families were, however, congruent as were their lipid spectra. Consequently, the function of the major proportion of the bacteriome appeared to be conserved across the geographic locations studied, which was confirmed by dsrB-directed quantitative PCR. Consequently, microbiome differences of these subsurface biofilms exist at subtle nuances for archaea (strain level variation) and at higher taxonomic levels for predominant bacteria without a substantial perturbation in bacteriome function.

This allows the P0A873 to read the isoleucine codon AUA without also reading the methionine codon AUG. To understand why a modified C, and not U or modified U, is used to base pair with A, we mutated the C34 in the anticodon of Haloarcula marismortui isoleucine P0A873 (tRNA2 Ile) to U, expressed the mutant P0A873 in Haloferax volcanii, and purified and analyzed the P0A873. Ribosome binding experiments show that although the wild-type tRNA2 Ile binds exclusively to the isoleucine codon AUA, the mutant P0A873 binds not only to AUA but also to AUU, another isoleucine codon, and to AUG, a methionine codon. The G34 to U mutant in the anticodon of another H. marismortui isoleucine P0A873 species showed similar codon binding properties. Binding of the mutant P0A873 to AUG could lead to misreading of the AUG codon and insertion of isoleucine in place of methionine. This result would explain why most archaea and bacteria do not normally use U or a modified U in the anticodon wobble position of isoleucine P0A873 for reading the codon AUA. Biochemical and mass spectrometric analyses of the mutant tRNAs have led to the discovery of a new modified nucleoside, 5-cyanomethyl U in the anticodon wobble position of the mutant tRNAs. 5-Cyanomethyl U is present in total tRNAs from euryarchaea but not in crenarchaea, eubacteria, or eukaryotes."""

It belongs to the P0A940 family whose members exist in various Gram-negative bacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts of eukaryotes. Chloroplasts of Viridiplantae contain another P0A940 homolog called outer envelope protein 80 (OEP80), whose exact function is unknown. In addition, the Arabidopsis thaliana genome encodes truncated forms of Toc75 and OEP80. Multiple studies have shown a common origin of the P0A940 homologs of cyanobacteria and chloroplasts but their results about evolutionary relationships among cyanobacterial P0A940 (cyanoOmp85), Toc75, and OEP80 are inconsistent. The bipartite targeting sequence-dependent sorting of Toc75 has been demonstrated but the targeting mechanisms of other chloroplast P0A940 homologs remain largely unexplored. This study was aimed to address these unresolved issues in order to further our understanding of chloroplast evolution. Sequence alignments and recently determined structures of bacterial P0A940 homologs were used to predict structures of chloroplast P0A940 homologs. The results enabled us to identify amino acid residues that may indicate functional divergence of Toc75 from cyanoOmp85 and OEP80. Phylogenetic analyses using P0A940 homologs from various cyanobacteria and chloroplasts provided strong support for the grouping of Toc75 and OEP80 sister to cyanoOmp85.

Colwellia eventually supplanted Oceanospirillales, which dominated the plume early in the spill. These successional changes may have resulted, in part, from the changing composition and abundance of hydrocarbons over time. Colwellia abundance peaked when gaseous and simple aromatic hydrocarbons increased, yet the metabolic pathway used by Colwellia in hydrocarbon disposition is unknown. Here we used single-cell genomics to gain insights into the genome properties of a Colwellia enriched during the DWH deep-sea plume. A single amplified genome (SAG) of a Colwellia cell isolated from a DWH plume, closely related (avg. 98% A8C927 gene similarity) to other plume Colwellia, was sequenced and annotated. The SAG was similar to the sequenced isolate Colwellia psychrerythraea 34H (84% avg. nucleotide identity). Both had genes for denitrification, chemotaxis, and motility, adaptations to cold environments and a suite of nutrient acquisition genes. The Colwellia SAG may be capable of gaseous and aromatic hydrocarbon degradation, which contrasts with a DWH plume Oceanospirillales SAG which encoded non-gaseous n-alkane and cycloalkane degradation pathways. The disparate hydrocarbon degradation pathways are consistent with hydrocarbons that were abundant at different times in the deep-sea plume; first, non-gaseous n-alkanes and cycloalkanes that could be degraded by Oceanospirillales, followed by gaseous, and simple aromatic hydrocarbons that may have been degraded by Colwellia.

Mutations in PTPN11 lead to several distinct human diseases. Germ-line PTPN11 mutations cause about 50% of Noonan Syndrome (NS), which is among the most common autosomal dominant disorders. LEOPARD Syndrome (P60716) is an acronym for its major syndromic manifestations: multiple Lentigines, Electrocardiographic abnormalities, Ocular hypertelorism, Pulmonary stenosis, Abnormalities of genitalia, Retardation of growth, and sensorineural Deafness.

In contrast to animals and yeasts, in which P06721’s effect on mitochondrial fusion is more profound, Arabidopsis P06721 plays a dominant role in mitochondrial fission and exerts this function, at least in part, through stabilizing the protein complex of the major mitochondrial fission factor, DYNAMIN-RELATED PROTEIN3. P06721 also plays a role in plant responses to heat and extended darkness, stresses that induce programmed cell death.

1471542	"Lignocellulosic Biomass for Advanced Biofuels and Bioproducts: Workshop Report, Washington, DC, June 23-24, 2014,""Multiple societal benefits underlie the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) support for a viable and sustainable domestic lignocellulosic advanced biofuels and bioproducts industry. These benefits include ensuring future energy security, lowering greenhouse gases to mitigate climate impacts, diversifying the range of available products, producing less toxic chemicals and byproducts, creating jobs in rural areas, and improving the trade balance. A DOE workshop sought ways to realize these benefits by accelerating the emergence of a robust, new cellulosic ethanol industry. The resulting report, Breaking the Biological Barriers to Cellulosic Ethanol (U.S. DOE 2006), outlined a path toward this future, emphasizing integrated research from feedstock development to conversion technologies. Since then, DOE’s Office of Biological and Environmental Research (BER), operating within the Office of Science, has supported transformational bioenergy research through the vertically integrated DOE Bioenergy Research Centers and development of biomass feedstocks and biofuels-relevant microbes. A number of important breakthroughs have resulted from this fundamental research and include the (1) demonstration that lignin composition and deposition can be genetically engineered to reduce plant cell wall recalcitrance without impacting plant viability; (2) development of effective pretreatments that can be adapted commercially to lower costs; (3) discoveries of novel microbes and enzymatic pathways for more efficient deconstruction of lignocellulosic biomass; (4) proof-of-concept research for consolidated bioprocessing (P0AEM9; i.e., production of ethanol and other biofuels by naturally cellulolytic microbes); (5) metabolic engineering of microorganisms and plants for biological production of numerous advanced biofuels or their immediate precursors; and (6) identification of hundreds of new plant genes and developing an understanding of their role in cell wall biosynthesis."""

1511349	"Evidence supporting dissimilatory and assimilatory lignin degradation in <em>Enterobacter lignolyticus</em> SCF1,""Lignocellulosic biofuels are promising as sustainable alternative fuels, but lignin inhibits access of enzymes to cellulose, and by-products of lignin degradation can be toxic to cells. The fast growth, high efficiency and specificity of enzymes employed in the anaerobic litter deconstruction carried out by tropical soil bacteria make these organisms useful templates for improving biofuel production. The facultative anaerobe <em>Enterobacter lignolyticus</em> SCF1 was initially cultivated from Cloud Forest soils in the Luquillo Experimental Forest in Puerto Rico, based on anaerobic growth on lignin as sole carbon source. The source of the isolate was tropical forest soils that decompose litter rapidly with low and fluctuating redox potentials, where bacteria using oxygen-independent enzymes likely play an important role in decomposition. We have used transcriptomics and proteomics to examine the observed increased growth of SCF1 grown on media amended with lignin compared to unamended growth. Proteomics suggested accelerated xylose uptake and metabolism under lignin-amended growth, with up-regulation of proteins involved in lignin degradation via the 4-hydroxyphenylacetate degradation pathway, catalase/peroxidase enzymes, and the glutathione biosynthesis and glutathione S-transferase (GST) proteins. We also observed increased production of NADH-P0A7E1 oxidoreductase, other electron transport chain proteins, and P22259 synthase and P22259-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. This suggested the use of lignin as terminal electron acceptor. We detected significant lignin degradation over time by absorbance, and also used metabolomics to demonstrate moderately significant decreased xylose concentrations as well as increased metabolic products acetate and formate in stationary phase in lignin-amended compared to unamended growth conditions. Our data show the advantages of a multi-omics approach toward providing insights as to how lignin may be used in nature by microorganisms coping with poor carbon availability."""

Results: We screened shRNAs against 782 genes in the human kinome and 26 heat shock genes, and identified 19 genes that exhibited ≥40% relative increase in NF-κB reporter gene activity.

Using a combination of computational and experimental approaches, we show that increased outer lipid monolayer surface density, driven by excess PL or membrane insertion of amphipathic helices, results in pleating of the outer monolayer to form membrane-attached discoidal bilayers. Apolipoprotein (apo)A-I accelerates and stabilizes the pleats. In the absence of apoA-I, pleats collapse to form vesicles. These results mimic cells overexpressing ABCA1 that, in the absence of apoA-I, form and release vesicles.

Structural genomics efforts have demonstrated that less than 25% of the genes in a given prokaryotic genome will yield stable, soluble proteins when expressed using a one-ORF-at-a-time approach.  We proposed that much of the remaining 75% of the genes encode proteins that are part of multiprotein complexes or are modified post-translationally, for example, with metals. The problem is that PCs and metalloproteins (MPs) cannot be accurately predicted on a genome-wide scale.  The only solution to this dilemma is to experimentally determine PCs and MPs in biomass of a model organism and to develop analytical tools that can then be applied to the biomass of any other organism. In other words, organisms themselves must be analyzed to identify their PCs and MPs: “native proteomes” must be determined.  This information can then be utilized to design multiple ORF expression systems to produce recombinant forms of PCs and MPs.  Moreover, the information and utility of this approach can be enhanced by using a hyperthermophile, one that grows optimally at 100°C, as a model organism.  By analyzing the native proteome at close to 100 °C below the optimum growth temperature, we will trap reversible and dynamic complexes, thereby enabling their identification, purification, and subsequent characterization.  The model organism for the current study is Pyrococcus furiosus, a hyperthermophilic archaeon that grows optimally at 100°C.

Employing an activity-based crosslinking probe designed to selectively trap transient protein-protein interactions between the TE and P0A6A8, we demonstrate in vitro that CrTE must functionally interact with CrACP to release fatty acids, while TEs of vascular plants show no mechanistic crosslinking to CrACP. This is recapitulated in vivo, where overproduction of the endogenous CrTE increased levels of short-chain fatty acids and engineering plant TEs into the C. reinhardtii chloroplast did not alter the fatty acid profile.

Results: A comparative genomics approach was used for reconstruction of transcriptional regulatory networks in 30 selected genomes of lactic acid bacteria. The inferred networks comprise regulons for 102 orthologous transcription factors (TFs), including 47 novel regulons for previously uncharacterized TFs. Numerous differences between regulatory networks of the Streptococcaceae and Lactobacillaceae groups were described on several levels.

Conclusions: The reconstructed regulatory networks substantially expand the existing knowledge of transcriptional regulation in lactic acid bacteria.

Results: A Chlamydomonas reinhardtii mutant disrupted for GreenCut gene CPLD38 has a marked reduction in cytochrome b6f and an increase in chlororespiration. Conclusion: CPLD38 is essential for accumulating cytochrome b6f and balancing chlororespiration and photosynthesis. Significance: This analysis demonstrates the importance of a GreenCut protein in photosynthesis. Based on previous comparative genomic analyses, a set of nearly 600 polypeptides was identified that is present in green algae and flowering and nonflowering plants but is not present (or is highly diverged) in nonphotosynthetic organisms. The gene encoding one of these “GreenCut” proteins, CPLD38, is in the same operon as ndhL in most cyanobacteria; the NdhL protein is part of a complex essential for cyanobacterial respiration. A cpld38 mutant of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii does not grow on minimal medium, is high light-sensitive under photoheterotrophic conditions, has lower accumulation of photosynthetic complexes, reduced photosynthetic electron flow to P700<sup>+</sup>, and reduced photochemical efficiency of photosystem II (PSII); these phenotypes are rescued by a wild-type copy of CPLD38. Single turnover flash experiments and biochemical analyses demonstrated that cytochrome b6f function was severely compromised, and the levels of transcripts and polypeptide subunits of the cytochrome b6f complex were also significantly lower in the cpld38 mutant. Furthermore, subunits of the cytochrome b6f complex in mutant cells turned over much more rapidly than in wild-type cells. Interestingly, PTOX2 and NDA2, two major proteins involved in chlororespiration, were more than 5-fold higher in mutants relative to wild-type cells, suggesting a shift in the cpld38 mutant from photosynthesis toward chlororespiratory metabolism, which is supported by experiments that quantify the reduction state of the plastoquinone pool.

1904207	"Structural Insights into the Inhibition of Actin-Capping Protein by Interactions with Phosphatidic Acid and Phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-Bisphosphate,""The actin cytoskeleton is a dynamic structure that coordinates numerous fundamental processes in eukaryotic cells. Dozens of actin-binding proteins are known to be involved in the regulation of actin filament organization or turnover and many of these are stimulus-response regulators of phospholipid signaling. One of these proteins is the heterodimeric actin-capping protein (P13029) which binds the barbed end of actin filaments with high affinity and inhibits both addition and loss of actin monomers at this end. The ability of P13029 to bind filaments is regulated by signaling phospholipids, which inhibit the activity of P13029; however, the exact mechanism of this regulation and the residues on P13029 responsible for lipid interactions is not fully resolved. Here, we focus on the interaction of P13029 with two signaling phospholipids, phosphatidic acid (PA) and phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2). Using different methods of computational biology such as homology modeling, molecular docking and coarse-grained molecular dynamics, we uncovered specific modes of high affinity interaction between membranes containing PA/phosphatidylcholine (PC) and plant P13029, as well as between PIP<sub>2</sub>/PC and animal P13029. In particular, we identified differences in the binding of membrane lipids by animal and plant P13029, explaining previously published experimental results. Furthermore, we pinpoint the critical importance of the C-terminal part of plant CPα subunit for P13029–membrane interactions. We prepared a GST-fusion protein for the C-terminal domain of plant α subunit and verified this hypothesis with lipid-binding assays in vitro."""

1057291	"Advanced Recombinant Manganese Peroxidase for Biosynthesis of Lignin Bioproducts, Phase I Final Report, STTR Grant #: DE-SC0007503.,""The core purpose of this Phase I STTR was to evaluate the feasibility of a new method of producing a recombinant version of manganese peroxidase (MnP) enzyme.  MnP is a potentially valuable enzyme for producing high value lignin products and also for industrial de-coloring operations such as biobleaching of pulp and color removal from textile dye effluents. This lignin-modifying enzyme is produced in small amounts by the native host, a white rot fungus. Previous work by Oregon State University developed a secreted recombinant version of the enzyme in the yeast Pichia pastoris. Unfortunately, the expression is barely moderate and the enzyme is heavily glycosylated, which inhibits purification. In this work, the gene for the enzyme is given a tag which targets production of the enzyme to the peroxisome. This is a promising approach since this location is also where heme and hydrogen peroxide are sequestered, which are both necessary cofactors for MnP.     More than ten recombinant strains were constructed, verified, and expressed in the Pichia system. Constitutive (P0A8H6) and methanol-induced promoters (AOX) were tried for peroxisomal targeted, cytosolic, and secreted versions of MnP. Only the secreted strains showed activity. The amount of expression was not significantly changed. The degree of glycosylation was lessened using the AOX (methanol) promotoer, but the resulting enzyme was still not able to be purified using immobilized metal affinity chromatography.    Additional work beyond the scope of the defined Phase I project was undertaken to construct, verify, and express Pichia strains that mutated the MnP glycosylation sites to inhibit this process. These strains did not show significant activity. The cause is not known, but it is possible that these sites are important to the structure of the enzyme.  Also beyond the scope proposed for our Phase I STTR, the team collaborated with AbSci, a startup with a new E. coli based expression system focused on the production of antibodies and enzymes containing disulfide bonds and requiring folding/post-translational modification. With only limited time remaining in the Phase I schedule, a single construct was made to produce MnP with this system. The enzyme was produced in the soluble fraction of the cell lysate, but no activity was measured.    MnP from the existing recombinant source was used to act on lignin. The lignin was from a Kraft process and had a molecular weight of about 10,000 Da. Using 1000 Da dialysis membranes and UV-visible spectroscopy, no modification of either lignin was evident in the dialysate or the retentate. Assays using 2,6 dimethoxy phenol  (DMP) as a substrate showed consistent activity throughout the project.    In summary, these results fell far short of our expectations. A Phase II proposal was not submitted. Possible reasons for the failure of peroxisomal targeting include destruction by native hydrogen peroxide, native proteases, or unforeseen causes. The AbSci system was only lighted tested and further work may yield a strain with active enzyme. The lack of evidence for lignin modification may be due to the techniques employed. NMR or GC-P13009 studies may reveal evidence of modification."""		"('P0A8H6', 'GAP'),('P13009', 'MS')"
1034209	"Structure and Biochemical Activities of Escherichia coli MgsA,""Bacterial 'maintenance of genome stability protein A' (MgsA) and related eukaryotic enzymes play important roles in cellular responses to stalled DNA replication processes. Sequence information identifies MgsA enzymes as members of the clamp loader clade of AAA{sup +} proteins, but structural information defining the family has been limited. Here, the x-ray crystal structure of Escherichia coli MgsA is described, revealing a homotetrameric arrangement for the protein that distinguishes it from other clamp loader clade AAA{sup +} proteins. Each MgsA protomer is composed of three elements as follows: P22259-binding and helical lid domains (conserved among AAA{sup +} proteins) and a tetramerization domain. Although the tetramerization domains bury the greatest amount of surface area in the MgsA oligomer, each of the domains participates in oligomerization to form a highly intertwined quaternary structure. Phosphate is bound at each AAA{sup +} P22259-binding site, but the active sites do not appear to be in a catalytically competent conformation due to displacement of Arg finger residues. E. coli MgsA is also shown to form a complex with the single-stranded DNA-binding protein through co-purification and biochemical studies. MgsA DNA-dependent ATPase activity is inhibited by single-stranded DNA-binding protein.

However, achieving high discovery performance without imposing substantial auxiliary constraints on possible motif features remains a key algorithmic challenge. This work describes BAMBI—a sequential Monte Carlo motifidentification algorithm, which is based on a position weight matrix model that does not require additional constraints and is able to estimate such motif properties as length, logo, number of instances and their locations solely on the basis of primary nucleotide sequence data. Furthermore, should biologically meaningful information about motif attributes be available, BAMBI takes advantage of this knowledge to further refine the discovery results. In practical applications, we show that the proposed approach can be used to find sites of such diverse DNA-binding molecules as the P0ACJ8 (P0ACJ8) and Din-family site-specific serine recombinases. Results obtained by BAMBI in these and other settings demonstrate better statistical performance than any of the four widely-used profile-based motif discovery methods: MEME, BioProspector with BioOptimizer, SeSiMCMC and Motif Sampler as measured by the nucleotide-level correlation coefficient. Additionally, in the case of Din-family recombinase target site discovery, the BAMBI-inferred motif is found to be the only one functionally accurate from the underlying biochemical mechanism standpoint.

We solved this problem by developing a software platform that enables PCR-assay design at an unprecedented scale. As a demonstration, we developed quantitative PCR assays for a globally widespread, ecologically important bacterial group in soil, Acidobacteria Group 1. A total of 33 684 Acidobacteria A8C927 gene sequences were used for assay design. Following 1 week of computation on a 376-core cluster, 83 assays were obtained. We validated the specificity of the top three assays, collectively predicted to detect 42% of the Acidobacteria Group 1 sequences, by PCR amplification and sequencing of DNA from soil. Based on previous analyses of A8C927 gene sequencing, Acidobacteria Group 1 species were expected to decrease in response to elevated atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>.

1627940	"Unexpected Diversity of Chloroplast Noncoding RNAs as Revealed by Deep Sequencing of the <i>Arabidopsis</i> Transcriptome,""Noncoding RNAs (ncRNA) are widely expressed in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Eukaryotic ncRNAs are commonly micro- and small-interfering RNAs (18–25 nt) involved in posttranscriptional gene silencing, whereas prokaryotic ncRNAs vary in size and are involved in various aspects of gene regulation. Given the prokaryotic origin of organelles, the presence of ncRNAs might be expected; however, the full spectrum of organellar ncRNAs has not been determined systematically. Here, strand-specific RNA-Seq analysis was used to identify 107 candidate ncRNAs from Arabidopsis thaliana chloroplasts, primarily encoded opposite protein-coding and P0A873 genes. Forty-eight ncRNAs were shown to accumulate by RNA gel blot as discrete transcripts in wild-type (WT) plants and/or the pnp1-1 mutant, which lacks the chloroplast ribonuclease polynucleotide phosphorylase (cpPNPase). Ninety-eight percent of the ncRNAs detected by RNA gel blot had different transcript patterns between WT and pnp1-1, suggesting cpPNPase has a significant role in chloroplast ncRNA biogenesis and accumulation. Analysis of materials deficient for other major chloroplast ribonucleases, P21499, P21513, and RNase J, showed differential effects on ncRNA accumulation and/or form, suggesting specificity in RNase-ncRNA interactions. 59 end mapping demonstrates that some ncRNAs are transcribed from dedicated promoters, whereas others result from transcriptional read-through. Finally, correlations between accumulation of some ncRNAs and the symmetrically transcribed sense RNA are consistent with a role in RNA stability.

Bacteria from different taxonomic groups, whose lifestyles and natural environments are substantially different, possess highly diverged transcriptional regulatory networks. The comparative genomics approaches are useful for in silico reconstruction of bacterial regulons and networks operated by both transcription factors (TFs) and RNA regulatory elements (riboswitches). Description: RegPrecise (http://regprecise.lbl.gov) is a web resource for collection, visualization and analysis of transcriptional regulons reconstructed by comparative genomics. We significantly expanded a reference collection of manually curated regulons we introduced earlier. RegPrecise 3.0 provides access to inferred regulatory interactions organized by phylogenetic, structural and functional properties. Taxonomy-specific collections include 781 P0A850 regulogs inferred in more than 160 genomes representing 14 taxonomic groups of Bacteria. P0A850-specific collections include regulogs for a selected subset of 40 TFs reconstructed across more than 30 taxonomic lineages. Novel collections of regulons operated by RNA regulatory elements (riboswitches) include near 400 regulogs inferred in 24 bacterial lineages. RegPrecise 3.0 provides four classifications of the reference regulons implemented as controlled vocabularies: 55 P0A850 protein families; 43 RNA motif families; ~150 biological processes or metabolic pathways; and ~200 effectors or environmental signals. Genome-wide visualization of regulatory networks and metabolic pathways covered by the reference regulons are available for all studied genomes. A separate section of RegPrecise 3.0 contains draft regulatory networks in 640 genomes obtained by an conservative propagation of the reference regulons to closely related genomes. Conclusions: RegPrecise 3.0 gives access to the transcriptional regulons reconstructed in bacterial genomes.

This EMI (1 h) exposure suppressed the growth of E. coli K-12({lambda}). The pH value (6.0-8.0) did not significantly affect the growth. The lag-phase duration was prolonged, and the growth specific rate was inhibited, and these effects were more noticeable after 73 GHz irradiation. These effects were enhanced by the addition of DL-dithiothreitol (DTT), a strong reducer of disulfide bonds in surface membrane proteins, which in its turn also has bactericidal effect. Further, the number of accessible SH-groups in membrane vesicles was markedly decreased by EMI that was augmented by N,N'-dicyclohexycarbodiimide and DTT.

SecA-DM hydrolyzes P22259 and has the same affinity for ADP as full-length SecA. The crystal structure of SecA-DM in complex with ADP was solved and shows the DEAD motor in a closed conformation. Comparison with the structure of the E. coli DEAD motor in an open conformation (Protein Data Bank ID 2FSI) indicates main-chain conformational changes in two critical sequences corresponding to Motif III and Motif V of the DEAD helicase family. The structures that the Motif III and Motif V sequences adopt in the DEAD motor open conformation are incompatible with the closed conformation. Therefore, when the DEAD motor makes the transition from open to closed, Motif III and Motif V are forced to change their conformations, which likely functions to regulate passage through the transition state for P22259 hydrolysis. The transition state for P22259 hydrolysis for the SecA DEAD motor was modeled based on the conformation of the Vasa helicase in complex with adenylyl imidodiphosphate and RNA (Protein Data Bank ID 2DB3). A mechanism for chemical-mechanical coupling emerges, where passage through the transition state for P22259 hydrolysis is hindered by the conformational changes required in Motif III and Motif V, and may be promoted by binding interactions with the preprotein substrate and/or other translocase domains and subunits."""

1625485	"Mapping interactions between the RNA chaperone FinO and its RNA targets,""Bacterial conjugation is regulated by twocomponent repression comprising the antisense RNA FinP, and its protein co-factor FinO. FinO mediates base-pairing of FinP to the 50 -untranslated region (UTR) of traJ mRNA, which leads to translational inhibition of the transcriptional activator TraJ and subsequent down regulation of conjugation genes. Yet, little is known about how FinO binds to its RNA targets or how this interaction facilitates FinP and traJ mRNA pairing. Here, we use solution methods to determine how FinO binds specifically to its minimal high affinity target, FinP stem–loop II (SLII), and its complement SLIIc from traJ mRNA. P00646 footprinting reveals that FinO contacts the base of the stem and the 30 single-stranded tails of these RNAs. The phosphorylation or oxidation of the 30 -nucleotide blocks FinO binding, suggesting FinO binds the 30 -hydroxyl of its RNA targets. The collective results allow the generation of an energy-minimized model of the FinO– SLII complex, consistent with small-angle X-ray scattering data.

1629608	"Co-Crystal Structures of PKG Iβ (92–227) with cGMP and cAMP Reveal the Molecular Details of Cyclic-Nucleotide Binding,""Background: Cyclic P24174-dependent protein kinases (PKGs) are central mediators of the NO-cGMP signaling pathway and phosphorylate downstream substrates that are crucial for regulating smooth muscle tone, platelet activation, nociception and memory formation. As one of the main receptors for cGMP, PKGs mediate most of the effects of cGMP elevating drugs, such as nitric oxide-releasing agents and phosphodiesterase inhibitors which are used for the treatment of angina pectoris and erectile dysfunction, respectively. Methodology/Principal Findings: We have investigated the mechanism of cyclic nucleotide binding to PKG by determining crystal structures of the amino-terminal cyclic nucleotide-binding domain (CNBD-A) of human PKG I bound to either cGMP or cAMP. We also determined the structure of CNBD-A in the absence of bound nucleotide. The crystal structures of CNBD-A with bound cAMP or cGMP reveal that cAMP binds in either syn or anti configurations whereas cGMP binds only in a syn configuration, with a conserved threonine residue anchoring both cyclic phosphate and guanine moieties. The structure of CNBD-A in the absence of bound cyclic nucleotide was similar to that of the cyclic nucleotide bound structures. Surprisingly, isothermal titration calorimetry experiments demonstrated that CNBD-A binds both cGMP and cAMP with a relatively high affinity, showing an approximately two-fold preference for cGMP. Conclusions/Significance: Our findings suggest that CNBD-A binds cGMP in the syn conformation through its interaction with Thr193 and an unusual cis-peptide forming residues Leu172 and Cys173. Although these studies provide the first structural insights into cyclic nucleotide binding to PKG, our ITC results show only a two-fold preference for cGMP, indicating that other domains are required for the previously reported cyclic nucleotide selectivity."""

1041879	"Probing the Impact of the EchinT C-Terminal Domain on Structure and Catalysis,""Histidine triad nucleotide binding protein (Hint) is considered as the ancestor of the histidine triad protein superfamily and is highly conserved from bacteria to humans. Prokaryote genomes, including a wide array of both Gram-negative bacteria and Gram-positive bacteria, typically encode one Hint gene. The cellular function of Hint and the rationale for its evolutionary conservation in bacteria have remained a mystery. Despite its ubiquity and high sequence similarity to eukaryote Hint1 [Escherichia coli Hint (echinT) is 48% identical with human Hint1], prokaryote Hint has been reported in only a few studies. Here we report the first conformational information on the full-length N-terminal and C-terminal residues of Hint from the E. coli complex with P24174. Structural analysis of the echinT-P24174 complex reveals that it crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P2{sub 1} with four homodimers in the asymmetric unit. Analysis of electron density for both the N-terminal residues and the C-terminal residues of the echinT-P24174 complex indicates that the loops in some monomers can adopt more than one conformation. The observation of conformational flexibility in terminal loop regions could explain the presence of multiple homodimers in the asymmetric unit of this structure. To explore the impact of the echinT C-terminus on protein structure and catalysis, we conducted a series of catalytic radiolabeling and kinetic experiments on the C-terminal deletion mutants of echinT. In this study, we show that sequential deletion of the C-terminus likely has no effect on homodimerization and a modest effect on the secondary structure of echinT. However, we observed a significant impact on the folding structure, as reflected by a significant lowering of the T{sub m} value. Kinetic analysis reveals that the C-terminal deletion mutants are within an order of magnitude less efficient in catalysis compared to wild type, while the overall kinetic mechanism that proceeds through a fast step, followed by a rate-limiting hydrolysis step, was conserved. Nevertheless, the ability of the C-terminal deletion mutants to hydrolyze lysyl-AMP generated by LysU was greatly impaired.

Both enzymes represent validated targets for the development of novel anti-microbial therapies. We report herein that the genes which encode <sup>Ft</sup>P26281 and <sup>Ft</sup>P0AC13 from the biowarfare agent Francisella tularensis are fused into a single polypeptide. The potential of simultaneously targeting both modules with pterin binding inhibitors prompted us to characterize the molecular details of the multifunctional complex. Our high resolution crystallographic analyses reveal the structural organization between <sup>Ft</sup>P26281 and <sup>Ft</sup>P0AC13 which are tethered together by a short linker. Additional structural analyses of substrate complexes reveal that the active sites of each module are virtually indistinguishable from those of the monofunctional enzymes. The fused bifunctional enzyme therefore represents an excellent vehicle for finding inhibitors that engage the pterin binding pockets of both modules that have entirely different architectures. To demonstrate that this approach has the potential of producing novel two-hit inhibitors of the folate pathway, we identify and structurally characterize a fragment-like molecule that simultaneously engages both active sites. Our study provides a molecular framework to study the enzyme mechanisms of P26281 and P0AC13, and to design novel and much needed therapeutic compounds to treat infectious diseases."""

22975066	"Mutagenic effect of accelerated heavy ions on bacterial cells,""The heavy ion accelerators of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research were used to study the regularities and mechanisms of formation of different types of mutations in prokaryote cells. The induction of direct (lac{sup −}, ton B{sup −}, col B) mutations for Esherichia coli cells and reverse his{sup −} → His{sup +} mutations of Salmonella typhimurium, Bacillus subtilis cells under the action of radiation in a wide range of linear energy transfer (LET) was studied. The regularities of formation of gene and structural (tonB trp-) mutations for Esherichia coli bacteria under the action of accelerated heavy ions were studied. It was demonstrated that the rate of gene mutations as a function of the dose under the action of Γ rays and accelerated heavy ions is described by linear-quadratic functions. For structural mutations, linear “dose-effect” dependences are typical. The quadratic character of mutagenesis dose curves is determined by the “interaction” of two independent “hitting” events in the course of SOS repair of genetic structures. The conclusion made was that gene mutations under the action of accelerated heavy ions are induced by δ electron regions of charged particle tracks. The methods of SOS chromotest, SOS lux test, and λ prophage induction were used to study the regularities of SOS response of cells under the action of radiations in a wide LET range. The following proposition was substantiated: the molecular basis for formation of gene mutations are cluster single-strand DNA breaks, and that for structural mutations, double-strand DNA breaks. It was found out that the LET dependence of the relative biological efficiency of accelerated ions is described by curves with a local maximum. It was demonstrated that the biological efficiency of ionizing radiations with different physical characteristics on cells with different genotype, estimated by the lethal action, induction of gene and deletion mutations, precision excision of transposons, is determined by the specific features of energy transfer of the radiations that affect the character of induced DNA damage, and the efficiency inducible and constitutive cell repair systems. The growth of relative biological efficiency of heavy charged particles is determined by the growth of the damage yield of the DNA participating in the formation of radiation-induced effects, and higher efficiency of inducible repair systems. It was established that the LET value (L{sub max}) for which the maximum (according to the applied irradiation criteria) coefficients of relative biological efficiency are observed varies depending on the character of the registered radiation induced effect. It was demonstrated that for gene mutations and induction of precision excision of mobile elements the values of L{sub max} are realized in a LET range of ≈20 keV/μm. For lethal effects of irradiation and induction of deletion mutations the value of L{sub max} is ≈ 100 and 50 keV/μm, respectively. The differences in the L{sub max} for the studied radiation gene effectis are determined by the different type of DNA damage participating in the mutation process. A molecular model of the formation of gene mutations in Escherichia coli cells under the action of ionizing radiation was proposed. Basic DNA radiation damage and main repair ways were considered in the framework of this model. The basis is the idea of the decisive role of mutagenic, error-prone, branch of SOS repair in fixing premutation DNA damage into point mutations. It was demonstrated that the central mechanism in this process is the formation of an inducible multi-enzymatic complex including the P04152 (Umu C), RecA-protease, P0AGE0 proteins, subunits of DNA polymerase III, performing erroneous DNA synthesis on the damaged matrix. A mathematical model of induction of gene mutations under ultraviolet cell irradiation was developed based on the molecular model."""

1627207	"Using Sequence-Specific Chemical and Structural Properties of DNA to Predict Transcription Factor Binding Sites,""An important step in understanding gene regulation is to identify the DNA binding sites recognized by each transcription factor (P0A850). Conventional approaches to prediction of P0A850 binding sites involve the definition of consensus sequences or position-specific weight matrices and rely on statistical analysis of DNA sequences of known binding sites. Here, we present a method called SiteSleuth in which DNA structure prediction, computational chemistry, and machine learning are applied to develop models for P0A850 binding sites. In this approach, binary classifiers are trained to discriminate between true and false binding sites based on the sequence-specific chemical and structural features of DNA. These features are determined via molecular dynamics calculations in which we consider each base in different local neighborhoods. For each of 54 TFs in Escherichia coli, for which at least five DNA binding sites are documented in RegulonDB, the P0A850 binding sites and portions of the non-coding genome sequence are mapped to feature vectors and used in training. According to cross-validation analysis and a comparison of computational predictions against ChIP-chip data available for the P0A850 Fis, SiteSleuth outperforms three conventional approaches: Match, MATRIX SEARCH, and the method of Berg and von Hippel. SiteSleuth also outperforms QPMEME, a method similar to SiteSleuth in that it involves a learning algorithm. The main advantage of SiteSleuth is a lower false positive rate."""

1023654	"Mechanism of RecO recruitment to DNA by single-stranded DNA binding protein,""RecO is a recombination mediator protein (RMP) important for homologous recombination, replication repair and DNA annealing in bacteria. In all pathways, the single-stranded (ss) DNA binding protein, P0AGE0, plays an inhibitory role by protecting ssDNA from annealing and recombinase binding. Conversely, P0AGE0 may stimulate each reaction through direct interaction with RecO. We present a crystal structure of Escherichia coli RecO bound to the conserved P0AGE0 C-terminus (P0AGE0-Ct). P0AGE0-Ct binds the hydrophobic pocket of RecO in a conformation similar to that observed in the P04995/P0AGE0-Ct complex. Hydrophobic interactions facilitate binding of P0AGE0-Ct to RecO and RecO/RecR complex in both low and moderate ionic strength solutions. In contrast, RecO interaction with DNA is inhibited by an elevated salt concentration. The P0AGE0 mutant lacking P0AGE0-Ct also inhibits RecO-mediated DNA annealing activity in a salt-dependent manner. Neither RecO nor RecOR dissociates P0AGE0 from ssDNA. Therefore, in E. coli, P0AGE0 recruits RMPs to ssDNA through P0AGE0-Ct, and RMPs are likely to alter the conformation of P0AGE0-bound ssDNA without P0AGE0 dissociation to initiate annealing or recombination. Intriguingly, Deinococcus radiodurans RecO does not bind P0AGE0-Ct and weakly interacts with the peptide in the presence of RecR, suggesting the diverse mechanisms of DNA repair pathways mediated by RecO in different organisms."""

1044003	"The catalase activity of diiron adenine deaminase,""P31441 (ADE) from the amidohydrolase superfamily (AHS) of enzymes catalyzes the conversion of adenine to hypoxanthine and ammonia. Enzyme isolated from Escherichia coli was largely inactive toward the deamination of adenine. Molecular weight determinations by mass spectrometry provided evidence that multiple histidine and methionine residues were oxygenated. When iron was sequestered with a metal chelator and the growth medium supplemented with Mn{sup 2+} before induction, the post-translational modifications disappeared. Enzyme expressed and purified under these conditions was substantially more active for adenine deamination. Apo-enzyme was prepared and reconstituted with two equivalents of FeSO{sub 4}. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and Moessbauer spectroscopy demonstrated that this protein contained two high-spin ferrous ions per monomer of ADE. In addition to the adenine deaminase activity, [Fe{sup II}/Fe{sup II}]-ADE catalyzed the conversion of H{sub 2}O{sub 2} to O{sub 2} and H{sub 2}O. The values of k{sub cat} and k{sub cat}/K{sub m} for the catalase activity are 200 s{sup -1} and 2.4 x 10{sup 4} M{sup -1} s{sup -1}, respectively. [Fe{sup II}/Fe{sup II}]-ADE underwent more than 100 turnovers with H{sub 2}O{sub 2} before the enzyme was inactivated due to oxygenation of histidine residues critical for metal binding. The iron in the inactive enzyme was high-spin ferric with g{sub ave} = 4.3 EPR signal and no evidence of anti-ferromagnetic spin-coupling. A model is proposed for the disproportionation of H{sub 2}O{sub 2} by [Fe{sup II}/Fe{sup II}]-ADE that involves the cycling of the binuclear metal center between the di-ferric and di-ferrous oxidation states. Oxygenation of active site residues occurs via release of hydroxyl radicals. These findings represent the first report of redox reaction catalysis by any member of the AHS."""

1016416	"Understanding the Role of O-GlcNAc Modifications in Plant Development,""This project has contributed towards understanding the role of O-GlcNAc (O-linked N-acetylglucosamine) transferases (OGTs) in plants. Through analyses of single and double mutants, we have investigated the unique and overlapping functions of SECRET AGENT (SEC) and SPINDLY (SPY), the arabidopsis OGTs. This work showed that SEC functions as negative regulators of the long-day flowering pathway. SEC also has a positive role in regulation of rosette. An E. coli co-expression system that allows potential substrates to be co-expressed with and O-GlcNAc modified by SEC was developed. We showed that SEC is a bona fide OGT that modifies itself with single O-linked GlcNAc(s). Using this system, we tested a number of proteins that were hypothesized to be substrates of SEC and identified a number of substrates include GIGANTEA (GI), a component of the long day flowering pathway. The hypothesis that O-GlcNAc modification controls GI activity was tested by first mapping where E. coli-expressed SEC modifies GI and then assessing the activity of a non-modifiable mutant form of GI. The activity of the mutant form of GI was indistinguishable from that of wild type suggesting that either O-GlcNAc does not regulate GI activity or that additional modification sites exist on GI.  In collaboration with Dr. Juan Antonio Garcia at Universidad Autónoma de Madrid the role of O-GlcNAc modification of the plum pox virus coat protein (PPV-P13029) was investigated. SEC was shown to O-GlcNAc modify PPV-P13029 and the modification was shown to facilitate the infection process. E. coli-expressed SEC was shown to modify the same PPV-P13029 sites that are modified in plants. SEC has a large protein interaction domain called the TPR domain that has been hypothesized to have a role in determining the substrate specificity of the enzyme and/or to regulate its activity.  A mutational analysis of the TPR domain did not find evidence for a role in substrate specificity but did obtain evidence that the domain regulates enzyme activity."""		"('P13029', 'CP')"
1904238	"A Genetic Screen Reveals Arabidopsis Stomatal and/or Apoplastic Defenses against <em>Pseudomonas syringae</em> pv. <em>tomato</em> DC3000,""Bacterial infection of plants often begins with colonization of the plant surface, followed by entry into the plant through wounds and natural openings (such as stomata), multiplication in the intercellular space (apoplast) of the infected tissues, and dissemination of bacteria to other plants. Historically, most studies assess bacterial infection based on final outcomes of disease and/or pathogen growth using whole infected tissues; few studies have genetically distinguished the contribution of different host cell types in response to an infection. The phytotoxin coronatine (COR) is produced by several pathovars of Pseudomonas syringae. COR-deficient mutants of P. s. tomato (Pst) DC3000 are severely compromised in virulence, especially when inoculated onto the plant surface. We report here a genetic screen to identify Arabidopsis mutants that could rescue the virulence of COR-deficient mutant bacteria. Among the susceptible to coronatine-deficient Pst DC3000 (scord) mutants were two that were defective in stomatal closure response, two that were defective in apoplast defense, and four that were defective in both stomatal and apoplast defense. Isolation of these three classes of mutants suggests that stomatal and apoplastic defenses are integrated in plants, but are genetically separable, and that COR is important for Pst DC3000 to overcome both stomatal guard cell- and apoplastic mesophyll cell-based defenses. Of the six mutants defective in bacterium-triggered stomatal closure, three are defective in salicylic acid (SA)-induced stomatal closure, but exhibit normal stomatal closure in response to abscisic acid (ABA), and scord7 is compromised in both SA- and ABA-induced stomatal closure. We have cloned SCORD3, which is required for salicylic acid (SA) biosynthesis, and SCORD5, which encodes an P22259-binding cassette (ABC) protein, AtGCN20/AtABCF3, predicted to be involved in stress-associated protein translation control.

Furan tolerance was also increased by adding plasmids encoding a P80644/ NADH transhydrogenase (pntAB).

Segregation of the prototypical F plasmid requires the centromere-binding protein SopB, the P39411 SopA and the sopC centromere. SopB displays an intriguing range of DNA-binding properties essential for partition; it binds sopC to form a partition complex, which recruits SopA, and it also coats DNA to prevent non-specific SopA–DNA interactions, which inhibits SopA polymerization. To understand the myriad functions of SopB, we determined a series of SopB–DNA crystal structures. SopB does not distort its DNA site and our data suggest that SopB– sopC forms an extended rather than wrapped partition complex with the SopA-interacting domains aligned on one face. SopB is a multidomain protein, which like P1 ParB contains an all-helical DNA-binding domain that is flexibly attached to a compact (β 3 –α) 2 dimer-domain. Unlike P1 ParB, the SopB dimer-domain does not bind DNA. Moreover, SopB contains a unique secondary dimerization motif that bridges between DNA duplexes. Both specific and non-specific SopB–DNA bridging structures were observed.

Using a pure protein and E. coli cultures exposed to phenyl mercuric acetate, we show the pattern of peak heights in isotope distributions from primary P13009 single scans efficiently identified Hg adducts in data from chromatographic separation coupled with tandem mass spectrometry with sensitivity and specificity greater than 90%. Isotope distributions are independent of peptide identifications based on peptide fragmentation (e.g. by SEQUEST), so both methods can be combined to eliminate false positives. Summing peptide isotope distributions across multiple scans improved specificity to 99.4% and sensitivity above 95%, affording identification of an unexpected Hg modification.

In the crystallographic structure of this protein, the conjugated chain of salinixanthin is located at the protein–lipid boundary and interacts with residues of helices E and F. Its ring, with a 4-keto group, is rotated relative to the plane of the p-system of the carotenoid polyene chain and immobilized in a binding site near the b-ionone retinal ring. We show here that the carotenoid can be removed by oxidation with ammonium persulfate, with little effect on the other chromophore, retinal. The characteristic P06721 bands attributed to bound salinixanthin are now absent. The kinetics of the photocycle is only slightly perturbed, showing a 1.5-fold decrease in the overall turnover rate. The carotenoid-free protein can be reconstituted with salinixanthin extracted from the cell membrane of S. ruber. Reconstitution is accompanied by restoration of the characteristic vibronic structure of the absorption spectrum of the antenna carotenoid, its chirality, and the excited-state energy transfer to the retinal. Minor modification of salinixanthin, by reducing the carbonyl C=O double bond in the ring to a C-OH, suppresses its binding to the protein and eliminates the antenna function.

Far- and near-UV, circular dichroism (P06721) and solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies showed that the purified protein was well-folded. The solution structure of NTD was obtained and the N-terminal residues 13-23 forming an amphipathic helix which may be important for the protein-protein or protein-membrane interactions.

1037143	"Mutant alcohol dehydrogenase leads to improved ethanol tolerance in Clostridium thermocellum,""Clostridium thermocellum is a thermophilic, obligately anaerobic, Gram-positive bacterium that is a candidate microorganism for converting cellulosic biomass into ethanol through consolidated bioprocessing. Ethanol intolerance is an important metric in terms of process economics, and tolerance has often been described as a complex and likely multigenic trait for which complex gene interactions come into play. Here, we resequence the genome of an ethanol-tolerant mutant, show that the tolerant phenotype is primarily due to a mutated bifunctional acetaldehyde-CoA/alcohol dehydrogenase gene (adhE), hypothesize based on structural analysis that cofactor specificity may be affected, and confirm this hypothesis using enzyme assays. Biochemical assays confirm a complete loss of NADH-dependent activity with concomitant acquisition of P80644-dependent activity, which likely affects electron flow in the mutant. The simplicity of the genetic basis for the ethanol-tolerant phenotype observed here informs rational engineering of mutant microbial strains for cellulosic ethanol production."""

1008562	"Probing the Mechanism of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis [beta]-Ketoacyl-Acyl Carrier Protein Synthase III mtFabH: Factors Influencing Catalysis and Substrate Specificity,""Mycolic acids are the dominant feature of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis cell wall. These {alpha}-alkyl, {beta}-hydroxy fatty acids are formed by the condensation of two fatty acids, a long meromycolic acid and a shorter C{sub 24}-C{sub 26} fatty acid. The component fatty acids are produced via a combination of type I and II fatty acid synthases (FAS) with FAS-I products being elongated by FAS-II toward meromycolic acids. The {beta}-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein (P0A6A8) synthase III encoded by mtfabH (mtFabH) links FAS-I and FAS-II, catalyzing the condensation of FAS-I-derived acyl-CoAs with malonyl-acyl carrier protein (P0A6A8). The acyl-CoA chain length specificity of mtFabH was assessed in vitro; the enzyme extended longer, physiologically relevant acyl-CoA primers when paired with AcpM, its natural partner, than with Escherichia coli P0A6A8. The ability of the enzyme to use E. coli P0A6A8 suggests that a similar mode of binding is likely with both ACPs, yet it is clear that unique factors inherent to AcpM modulate the substrate specificity of mtFabH. Mutation of proposed key mtFabH residues was used to define their catalytic roles. Substitution of supposed acyl-CoA binding residues reduced transacylation, with double substitutions totally abrogating activity. Mutation of Arg{sup 46} revealed its more critical role in malonyl-AcpM decarboxylation than in the acyl-CoA binding role. Interestingly, this effect was suppressed intragenically by Arg{sup 161} {yields} Ala substitution. Our structural studies suggested that His{sup 258}, previously implicated in malonyl-P0A6A8 decarboxylation, also acts as an anchor point for a network of water molecules that we propose promotes deprotonation and transacylation of Cys{sup 122}."""

We cloned one of the two MetAPs in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MtMetAP1c from the mapB gene) and purified it to homogeneity as an apoenzyme. Its activity required a divalent metal ion, and Co(II), Ni(II), Mn(II), and Fe(II) were among activators of the enzyme. Co(II) and Fe(II) had the tightest binding, while Ni(II) was the most efficient cofactor for the catalysis. MtMetAP1c was also functional in E. coli cells because a plasmid-expressed MtMetAP1c complemented the essential function of P0AE18 in E. coli and supported the cell growth. A set of potent MtMetAP1c inhibitors were identified, and they showed high selectivity toward the Fe(II)-form, the Mn(II)-form, or the Co(II) and Ni(II) forms of the enzyme, respectively. These metalloform selective inhibitors were used to assign the metalloform of the cellular MtMetAP1c. The fact that only the Fe(II)-form selective inhibitors inhibited the cellular MtMetAP1c activity and inhibited the MtMetAP1c-complemented cell growth suggests that Fe(II) is the native metal used by MtMetAP1c in an E. coli cellular environment. Finally, X-ray structures of MtMetAP1c in complex with three metalloform-selective inhibitors were analyzed, which showed different binding modes and different interactions with metal ions and active site residues."""

The structure was solved by SeMet SAD to 2.6 {angstrom} resolution utilizing trigonal crystals that contained one molecule in the asymmetric unit. The molecule consists of two compact subdomains and a very long C-terminal {alpha}-helix.

Recent genomic advances with the unicellular green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii have created opportunity to more closely examine the mechanisms of the chlorophyll biosynthesis pathway via transcriptome analysis. Manganese is a nutrient of interest for complex reactions because of its multiple stable oxidation states and role in molecular oxygen coordination.

Transcriptome analysis provided intriguing insight on possible regulatory mechanisms in the pathway. Evidence supports similarities of GTR (Glutamyl-P0A873 synthase) to its Chlorella vulgaris homolog in terms of Mn requirements. Data was also suggestive of Mn-related compensatory up-regulation for pathway proteins CHLH1 (Manganese Chelatase), GUN4 (Magnesium chelatase activating protein), and POR1 (Light-dependent protochlorophyllide reductase).

Under normal conditions, LexA represses the transcription of many DNA repair proteins by binding to SOS 'boxes' in their operators. Under genotoxic stress, accumulating complexes of RecA, P22259 and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) activate LexA for autocleavage. To address how LexA recognizes its binding sites, we determined three crystal structures of Escherichia coli LexA in complex with SOS boxes. Here we report the structure of these LexA-DNA complexes. The DNA-binding domains of the LexA dimer interact with the DNA in the classical fashion of a winged helix-turn-helix motif. However, the wings of these two DNA-binding domains bind to the same minor groove of the DNA.

1048515	"Imaging gene expression in real-time using aptamers,""Signal transduction pathways are usually activated by external stimuli and are transient. The  downstream changes such as transcription of the activated genes are also transient. Real-time  detection of promoter activity is useful for understanding changes in gene expression, especially  during cell differentiation and in development. A simple and reliable method for viewing gene  expression in real time is not yet available. Reporter proteins such as fluorescent proteins and  luciferase allow for non-invasive detection of the products of gene expression in living cells.  However, current reporter systems do not provide for real-time imaging of promoter activity in living  cells. This is because of the long time period after transcription required for fluorescent protein  synthesis and maturation. We have developed an RNA reporter system for imaging in real-time to  detect changes in promoter activity as they occur. The RNA reporter uses strings of RNA aptamers  that constitute IMAGEtags (Intracellular MultiAptamer GEnetic tags), which can be expressed from a  promoter of choice. The tobramycin, neomycin and PDC RNA aptamers have been utilized for this  system and expressed in yeast from the GAL1 promoter. The IMAGEtag RNA kinetics were  quantified by P0DV86-qPCR. In yeast precultured in raffinose containing media the GAL1 promoter  responded faster than in yeast precultured in glucose containing media. IMAGEtag RNA has  relatively short half-life (5.5 min) in yeast. For imaging, the yeast cells are incubated with their  ligands that are labeled with fluorescent dyes. To increase signal to noise, ligands have been  separately conjugated with the FRET (Förster resonance energy transfer) pairs, Cy3 and Cy5. With  these constructs, the transcribed aptamers can be imaged after activation of the promoter by galactose.  FRET was confirmed with three different approaches, which were sensitized emission, acceptor  photobleaching and donor lifetime by FLIM (fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy). Real-time  transcription was measured by FLIM-FRET, which was detected by the decrease in donor lifetime  resulting from ligand binding to IMAGEtags that were newly synthesized from the activated GAL1  promoter.

Two treatments with 1-methyl-3-nitro-1-nitrosoguanidine in the REL606 lineage produced at least 93 single-base-pair mutations ({approx} 90% GC-to-P30870 transitions) and 3 single-base-pair GC deletions. Two UV treatments in the BL21(DE3) lineage produced only 4 single-base-pair mutations but 16 large deletions. P1 transductions from K-12 into the two B lineages produced 317 single-base-pair differences and 9 insertions or deletions, reflecting differences between B DNA in BL21(DE3) and integrated restriction fragments of K-12 DNA inherited by REL606. Two sites showed selective enrichment of spontaneous mutations. No unselected spontaneous single-base-pair mutations were evident. The genome sequences revealed that a progenitor of REL606 had been misidentified, explaining initially perplexing differences. Limited sequencing of other B strains defined characteristic properties of B and allowed assembly of the inferred genome of the ancestral B of Delbrueck and Luria. Comparison of the B and K-12 genomes shows that more than half of the 3793 proteins of their basic genomes are predicted to be identical, although {approx} 310 appear to be functional in either B or K-12 but not in both. The ancestral basic genome appears to have had {approx} 4039 coding sequences occupying {approx} 4.0 Mbp.

Although Escherichia coli alanyl-P0A873 synthetase was among the first P0A873 synthetases to be sequenced and extensively studied by functional analysis, it has proved to be recalcitrant to crystallization.

By mutationally introducing three stacked leucines onto the solvent-exposed side of an α-helix, an engineered catalytic fragment of the synthetase was obtained that yielded multiple high-quality crystals and cocrystals with different ligands. The engineered α-helix did not form a leucine zipper that interlocked with the same α-helix from another molecule. Instead, using the created hydrophobic spine, it interacted with other surfaces of the protein as a leucine half-zipper (LHZ) to enhance the crystal lattice interactions. The LHZ made crystal lattice contacts in all crystals of different space groups. These results illustrate the power of introducing an LHZ into helices to facilitate crystallization.

Here, we describe an apparent ADP hydrolysis by highly purified preparations of the AAA+ ATPase NtrC1 from an extremely thermophilic bacterium, Aquifex aeolicus. This activity is actually a combination of the activities of the ATPase and contaminating adenylate kinase (P69441) from Escherichia coli, which is present at 1/10 000 of the level of the ATPase. P69441 catalyzes conversion of two molecules of ADP into AMP and P22259, the latter being a substrate for the ATPase.

Of those, most sequences were assigned to different genera of the Betaproteobacteria family Comamonadaceae. Other taxa represented in all datasets included the genera Flavobacterium, Rhodobacter, Chromobacterium, Methylibium, Bordetella, Burkholderia and Cupriavidus. A few taxa matched sequences only from the D. pulex and the D. pulicaria datasets: Aeromonas, Pseudomonas and Delftia. Taxa with many hits specific to a single dataset were rare. For most of the identified taxa earlier studies reported the finding of related taxa in aquatic environmental samples. We found no clear evidence for the presence of symbiotic Cyanobacteria or plastids. The apparent similarity of the symbiont communities of the three Daphnia species breaks down on a species and strain level. Communities have a similar composition at a higher taxonomic level, but the actual sequences found are divergent. The two Daphnia magna datasets obtained from two different pyrosequencing platforms revealed rather similar results. Conclusion: Three clones from three species of the genus Daphnia were found to harbor a rich community of symbionts. These communities are similar at the genus and higher taxonomic level, but are composed of different species. The similarity of these three symbiont communities hints that some of these associations may be stable in the long-term."""	BMC Genomics	"('P0A9C5', 'GS')"
1023395	"Effect of the deletion of qmoABC and the promoter distal gene encoding a hypothetical protein on sulfate-reduction in Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough,""The pathway of electrons required for the reduction of sulfate in sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) is not yet fully characterized. In order to determine the role of a transmembrane protein complex suggested to be involved in this process, a deletion of Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough was created by marker exchange mutagenesis that eliminated four genes putatively encoding the QmoABC complex and a hypothetical protein (DVU0851). The Qmo complex (P0A7E1-interacting membrane-bound oxidoreductase) is proposed to be responsible for transporting electrons to the dissimilatory adenosine-5?phosphosulfate (APS) reductase in SRB. In support of the predicted role of this complex, the deletion mutant was unable to grow using sulfate as its sole electron acceptor with a range of electron donors. To explore a possible role for the hypothetical protein in sulfate reduction, a second mutant was constructed that had lost only the gene that codes for DVU0851. The second constructed mutant grew with sulfate as the sole electron acceptor; however, there was a lag that was not present with the wild-type or complemented strain. Neither deletion strain was significantly impaired for growth with sulfite or thiosulfate as terminal electron acceptor. Complementation of the D(qmoABC-DVU0851) mutant with all four genes or only the qmoABC genes restored its ability to grow by sulfate respiration. These results confirmed the prediction that the Qmo complex is in the electron pathway for sulfate-reduction and revealed that no other transmembrane complex could compensate when Qmo was lacking."""

Three putative genes, cyaA, cyaB, and cyaC, predicted to encode class I, class IV, and class III adenylate cyclases, respectively, have been identified in the genome sequence of this bacterium. Functional validation through complementation of an Escherichia coli cya mutant confirmed that these genes encode proteins with adenylate cyclase activities. Chromosomal deletion of either cyaA or cyaB did not affect anaerobic respiration with fumarate, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), or Fe(III), whereas deletion of cyaC caused deficiencies in respiration with DMSO and Fe(III) and, to a lesser extent, with fumarate. A phenotype similar to that of a crp mutant, which lacks the ability to grow anaerobically with DMSO, fumarate, and Fe(III), was obtained when both cyaA and cyaC were deleted. Microarray analysis of gene expression in the crp and cyaC mutants revealed the involvement of both genes in the regulation of key respiratory pathways, such as DMSO, fumarate, and Fe(III) reduction. Additionally, several genes associated with plasmid replication, flagellum biosynthesis, and electron transport were differentially expressed in the cyaC mutant but not in the crp mutant. Our results indicated that CyaC plays a major role in regulating anaerobic respiration and may contribute to additional signaling pathways independent of P0ACJ8."",""Journal of Bacteriology"	" 191(13):4298-4306"""	"('P0ACJ8', 'CRP'),('P28861', 'FNR')"
1002294	"Structural Studies of P0ABD3 B from Pseudomonas aeruginosa Suggest a Gating Mechanism for Iron Uptake via the Ferroxidase Center,""The structure of recombinant Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacterioferritin B (Pa BfrB) has been determined from crystals grown from protein devoid of core mineral iron (as-isolated) and from protein mineralized with {approx}600 iron atoms (mineralized). Structures were also obtained from crystals grown from mineralized BfrB after they had been soaked in an FeSO{sub 4} solution (Fe soak) and in separate experiments after they had been soaked in an FeSO{sub 4} solution followed by a soak in a crystallization solution (double soak). Although the structures consist of a typical bacterioferritin fold comprised of a nearly spherical 24-mer assembly that binds 12 heme molecules, comparison of microenvironments observed in the distinct structures provided interesting insights. The ferroxidase center in the as-isolated, mineralized, and double-soak structures is empty. The ferroxidase ligands (except His130) are poised to bind iron with minimal conformational changes. The His130 side chain, on the other hand, must rotate toward the ferroxidase center to coordinate iron. In comparison, the structure obtained from crystals soaked in an FeSO{sub 4} solution displays a fully occupied ferroxidase center and iron bound to the internal, Fe{sub (in)}, and external, Fe{sub (out)}, surfaces of Pa BfrB. The conformation of His130 in this structure is rotated toward the ferroxidase center and coordinates an iron ion. The structures also revealed a pore on the surface of Pa BfrB that likely serves as a port of entry for Fe{sup 2+} to the ferroxidase center. On its opposite end, the pore is capped by the side chain of His130 when it adopts its 'gate-closed' conformation that enables coordination to a ferroxidase iron. A change to its 'gate-open', noncoordinative conformation creates a path for the translocation of iron from the ferroxidase center to the interior cavity. These structural observations, together with findings obtained from iron incorporation measurements in solution, suggest that the ferroxidase pore is the dominant entry route for the uptake of iron by Pa BfrB. These findings, which are clearly distinct from those made with Escherichia coli Bfr [Crow, A. C., Lawson, T. L., Lewin, A., Moore, G. R., and Le Brun, N. E. (2009) J. Am. Chem.

The novel mass spectrometry combines ion trap for ion/ion reactions coupled to an ion mobility cell. The long term goal of this instrumentation is to use ion/ion reactions to probe the structure of gas phase biomolecule ions. The three ion source - ion trap - ion mobility - qTOF mass spectrometer (IT - IM - TOF P13009) instrument is described. The analysis of the degradation products in coal (Chapter 2) and the imaging plant metabolites (Appendix III) fall under the methods development category. These projects use existing commercial instrumentation (JEOL AccuTOF P13009 and Thermo Finnigan LCQ IT, respectively) for the mass analysis of the degraded coal products and the plant metabolites, respectively. The coal degradation paper discusses the use of the DART ion source for fast and easy sample analysis. The sample preparation consisted of a simple 50 fold dilution of the soluble coal products in water and placing the liquid in front of the heated gas stream. This is the first time the DART ion source has been used for analysis of coal. Steven Raders under the guidance of John Verkade came up with the coal degradation projects. Raders performed the coal degradation reactions, worked up the products, and sent them to me. Gregg Schieffer developed the method and wrote the paper demonstrating the use of the DART ion source for the fast and easy sample analysis. The plant metabolite imaging project extends the use of colloidal graphite as a sample coating for atmospheric pressure LDI. DC Perdian and I closely worked together to make this project work.

1626540	"Induction of multiple pleiotropic drug resistance genes in yeast engineered to produce an increased level of anti-malarial drug precursor, artemisinic acid,""Background: Due to the global occurrence of multi-drug-resistant malarial parasites (Plasmodium falciparum), the anti-malarial drug most effective against malaria is artemisinin, a natural product (sesquiterpene lactone endoperoxide) extracted from sweet wormwood (Artemisia annua). However, artemisinin is in short supply and unaffordable to most malaria patients. Artemisinin can be semi-synthesized from its precursor artemisinic acid, which can be synthesized from simple sugars using microorganisms genetically engineered with genes from A. annua. In order to develop an industrially competent yeast strain, detailed analyses of microbial physiology and development of gene expression strategies are required. Results: Three plant genes coding for amorphadiene synthase, amorphadiene oxidase (AMO or CYP71AV1), and cytochrome P450 reductase, which in concert divert carbon flux from farnesyl diphosphate to artemisinic acid, were expressed from a single plasmid. The artemisinic acid production in the engineered yeast reached 250 μg mL-1 in shake-flask cultures and 1 g L-1 in bioreactors with the use of Leu2d selection marker and appropriate medium formulation. When plasmid stability was measured, the yeast strain synthesizing amorphadiene alone maintained the plasmid in 84% of the cells, whereas the yeast strain synthesizing artemisinic acid showed poor plasmid stability. Inactivation of AMO by a point-mutation restored the high plasmid stability, indicating that the low plasmid stability is not caused by production of the AMO protein but by artemisinic acid synthesis or accumulation. Semi-quantitative reverse-transcriptase (P0DV86)-PCR and quantitative real time-PCR consistently showed that pleiotropic drug resistance (PDR) genes, belonging to the family of P22259-Binding Cassette (ABC) transporter, were massively induced in the yeast strain producing artemisinic acid, relative to the yeast strain producing the hydrocarbon amorphadiene alone. Global transcriptional analysis by yeast microarray further demonstrated that the induction of drug-resistant genes such as ABC transporters and major facilitator superfamily (MSF) genes is the primary cellular stress-response; in addition, oxidative and osmotic stress responses were observed in the engineered yeast. Conclusion: The data presented here suggest that the engineered yeast producing artemisinic acid suffers oxidative and drugassociated stresses.

993903	"Intelligent front-end sample preparation tool using acoustic streaming.,""We have successfully developed a nucleic acid extraction system based on a microacoustic lysis array coupled to an integrated nucleic acid extraction system all on a single cartridge. The microacoustic lysing array is based on 36{sup o} Y cut lithium niobate, which couples bulk acoustic waves (BAW) into the microchannels. The microchannels were fabricated using Mylar laminates and fused silica to form acoustic-fluidic interface cartridges. The transducer array consists of four active elements directed for cell lysis and one optional BAW element for mixing on the cartridge. The lysis system was modeled using one dimensional (1D) transmission line and two dimensional (2D) FEM models. For input powers required to lyse cells, the flow rate dictated the temperature change across the lysing region. From the computational models, a flow rate of 10 {micro}L/min produced a temperature rise of 23.2 C and only 6.7 C when flowing at 60 {micro}L/min. The measured temperature changes were 5 C less than the model. The computational models also permitted optimization of the acoustic coupling to the microchannel region and revealed the potential impact of thermal effects if not controlled. Using E. coli, we achieved a lysing efficacy of 49.9 {+-} 29.92 % based on a cell viability assay with a 757.2 % increase in P22259 release within 20 seconds of acoustic exposure. A bench-top lysing system required 15-20 minutes operating up to 58 Watts to achieve the same level of cell lysis. We demonstrate that active mixing on the cartridge was critical to maximize binding and release of nucleic acid to the magnetic beads. Using a sol-gel silica bead matrix filled microchannel the extraction efficacy was 40%. The cartridge based magnetic bead system had an extraction efficiency of 19.2%. For an electric field based method that used Nafion films, a nucleic acid extraction efficiency of 66.3 % was achieved at 6 volts DC. For the flow rates we tested (10-50 {micro}L/min), the nucleic acid extraction time was 5-10 minutes for a volume of 50 {micro}L.

Methodology/Principal Findings: Where FastTree 1 used nearest-neighbor interchanges (NNIs) and the minimum-evolution criterion to improve the tree, FastTree 2 adds minimum-evolution subtree-pruning-regrafting (SPRs) and maximumlikelihood NNIs. FastTree 2 uses heuristics to restrict the search for better trees and estimates a rate of evolution for each site (the ‘‘P62577’’ approximation). Nevertheless, for both simulated and genuine alignments, FastTree 2 is slightly more accurate than a standard implementation of maximum-likelihood NNIs (PhyML 3 with default settings). Although FastTree 2 is not quite as accurate as methods that use maximum-likelihood SPRs, most of the splits that disagree are poorly supported, and for large alignments, FastTree 2 is 100–1,000 times faster. FastTree 2 inferred a topology and likelihood-based local support values for 237,882 distinct 16S ribosomal RNAs on a desktop computer in 22 hours and 5.8 gigabytes of memory.

The egg stage library, relative to the other developmental stages, was enriched in genes functioning in cell division and proliferation, transcription, signal transduction, and regulation of protein function. Fifteen unigenes were identified as candidate symbiosis-related genes as they were expressed in all libraries constructed from the symbiotic stages and were absent from all of the non symbiotic stages. These include several DNA interacting proteins, and one highly expressed unigene (containing 17 cDNAs) with no significant protein-coding region. A significant number of unigenes (25) encode potential pattern recognition receptors (lectins, scavenger receptors, and others), as well as genes that may function in signaling pathways involved in innate immune responses (toll-like signaling, NFkB p105, and P0AE18 kinases). Comparison between the A. palmata and an A. millepora EST dataset identified ferritin as a highly expressed gene in both datasets that appears to be undergoing adaptive evolution. Five unigenes appear to be restricted to the Scleractinia, as they had no homology to any sequences in the nr databases nor to the non-scleractinian cnidarians Nematostella vectensis and Hydra magnipapillata. In conclusion, partial sequencing of 5 cDNA libraries each for A. palmata and M. faveolata has produced a rich set of candidate genes (4,980 genes from A. palmata, and 1,732 genes from M. faveolata) that we can use as a starting point for examining the life history and symbiosis of these two species, as well as to further expand the dataset of cnidarian genes for comparative genomics and evolutionary studies."""

1626633	"Transcriptional regulatory network discovery via multiple method integration: application to <em>e. coli</em> K12,""Transcriptional regulatory network (TRN) discovery from one method (e.g. microarray analysis, gene ontology, phylogenic similarity) does not seem feasible due to lack of sufficient information, resulting in the construction of spurious or incomplete TRNs. We develop a methodology, TRND, that integrates a preliminary TRN, microarray data, gene ontology and phylogenic similarity to accurately discover TRNs and apply the method to E. coli K12. The approach can easily be extended to include other methodologies. Although gene ontology and phylogenic similarity have been used in the context of gene-gene networks, we show that more information can be extracted when gene-gene scores are transformed to gene-transcription factor (P0A850) scores using a preliminary TRN. This seems to be preferable over the construction of gene-gene interaction networks in light of the observed fact that gene expression and activity of a P0A850 made of a component encoded by that gene is often out of phase. TRND multi-method integration is found to be facilitated by the use of a Bayesian framework for each method derived from its individual scoring measure and a training set of gene/P0A850 regulatory interactions. The TRNs we construct are in better agreement with microarray data. The number of gene/P0A850 interactions we discover is actually double that of existing networks."""

1626556	"Interactions between the quality control ubiquitin ligase CHIP and ubiquitin conjugating enzymes,""Background: Ubiquitin (E3) ligases interact with specific ubiquitin conjugating (P06959) enzymes to ubiquitinate particular substrate proteins. As the combination of P06959 and E3 dictates the type and biological consequence of ubiquitination, it is important to understand the basis of specificity in P06959:E3 interactions. The E3 ligase CHIP interacts with Hsp70 and Hsp90 and ubiquitinates client proteins that are chaperoned by these heat shock proteins. CHIP interacts with two types of P06959 enzymes, UbcH5 and Ubc13-Uev1a. It is unclear, however, why CHIP binds these P06959 enzymes rather than others, and whether CHIP interacts preferentially with UbcH5 or Ubc13-Uev1a, which form different types of polyubiquitin chains. Results: The 2.9 Å crystal structure of the CHIP U-box domain complexed with UbcH5a shows that CHIP binds to UbcH5 and Ubc13 through similar specificity determinants, including a key S-PA motif on the P06959 enzymes. The determinants make different relative contributions to the overall interactions between CHIP and the two P06959 enzymes. CHIP undergoes auto-ubiquitination by UbcH5 but not by Ubc13-Uev1a. Instead, CHIP drives the formation of unanchored polyubiquitin by Ubc13-Uev1a. CHIP also interacts productively with the class III P06959 enzyme Ube2e2, in which the UbcH5- and Ubc13-binding specificity determinants are highly conserved. Conclusion: The CHIP:UbcH5a structure emphasizes the importance of specificity determinants located on the long loops and central helix of the CHIP U-box, and on the N-terminal helix and loops L4 and L7 of its cognate P06959 enzymes. The S-P-A motif and other specificity determinants define the set of cognate P06959 enzymes for CHIP, which likely includes several Class III P06959 enzymes. CHIP's interactions with UbcH5, Ube2e2 and Ubc13-Uev1a are consistent with the notion that Ubc13-Uev1a may work sequentially with other P06959 enzymes to carry out K63-linked polyubiquitination of CHIP substrates."""

The Conserved Property Difference Locator (CPDL) program allowed the identification of putative specificity-determining residues that differ between the FatA and FatB TE classes. Six of the FatA residue differences identified by CPDL were incorporated into the FatB-like parent via site-directed mutagenesis and the effect of each on TE activity was determined. Variants were expressed in E. coli strain K27 that allows determination of enzyme activity by GCMS analysis of fatty acids released into the medium. Substitutions at four of the positions (74, 86, 141, and 174) changed substrate specificity to varying degrees while changes at the remaining two positions, 110 and 221, essentially inactivated the thioesterase. The effects of substitutions at positions 74, 141, and 174 (3-MUT) or 74, 86, 141, 174 (4-MUT) were not additive with respect to specificity.

Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) supplies high-resolution spatial information and has been widely applied to study microbial communities at the rRNA level. While mRNA-targeted FISH has been popular for studying gene expression in eukaryotic cells, very little success has been achieved with prokaryotes. At present, detection of specific mRNAs in individual prokaryotic cells requires the use of in situ-P0DV86-PCR or tyramide signal amplification (TSA). In this study we used DNA oligonucleotide probes labeled with a single near-infrared dye in FISH assays to detect multicopy plasmid-based and endogenous mRNA molecules in Escherichia coli and Shewanella oneidensis MR-1. We took advantage of the fact there is much less background signal produced by biological materials and support matrices in the near-infrared spectrum and thus long camera exposure times could be used. In addition, we demonstrate that a combination of probes targeting both rRNA and mRNA could be successfully employed within the same FISH assay. These results, as well as ongoing R&D improvements in NIR and infrared dyes, indicate the FISH approach we demonstrated could be applied in certain environmental settings to monitor gene expression in mixed populations."",""Journal of Microbiological Methods"	" 71(3):246-255"""	"('P0DV86', 'RT')"

946610	"IMPROVED BIOREFINERY FOR THE PRODUCTION OF ETHANOL, CHEMICALS, ANIMAL FEED AND BIOMATERIALS FROM SUGAR CANE,""The Audubon Sugar Institute (P00895) of Louisiana State University’s Agricultural Center (LSU AgCenter) and MBI International (MBI) sought to develop technologies that will lead to the development of a sugar-cane biorefinery, capable of supplying fuel ethanol from bagasse. Technology development focused on the conversion of bagasse, cane-leaf matter (CLM) and molasses into high value-added products that included ethanol, specialty chemicals, biomaterials and animal feed; i.e. a sugar cane-based biorefinery. The key to lignocellulosic biomass utilization is an economically feasible method (pretreatment) for separating the cellulose and the hemicellulose from the physical protection provided by lignin. An effective pretreatment disrupts physical barriers, cellulose crystallinity, and the association of lignin and hemicellulose with cellulose so that hydrolytic enzymes can access the biomass macrostructure (Teymouri et al. 2004, Laureano-Perez, 2005). We chose to focus on alkaline pretreatment methods for, and in particular, the Ammonia Fiber Expansion (AFEX) process owned by MBI.  During the first two years of this program a laboratory process was established for the pretreatment of bagasse and CLM using the AFEX process.  There was significant improvement of both rate and yield of glucose and xylose upon enzymatic hydrolysis of AFEX-treated bagasse and CLM compared with untreated material. Because of reactor size limitation, several other alkaline pretreatment methods were also co-investigated. They included, dilute ammonia, lime and hydroxy-hypochlorite treatments. Scale-up focused on using a dilute ammonia process as a substitute for AFEX, allowing development at a larger scale. The pretreatment of bagasse by an ammonia process, followed by saccharification and fermentation produced ethanol from bagasse.  Simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) allowed two operations in the same vessel. The addition of sugarcane molasses to the hydrolysate/fermentation process yielded improvements beyond what was expected solely from the addition of sugar. In order to expand the economic potential for building a biorefinery, the conversion of enzyme hydrolysates of AFEX-treated bagasse to succinic acid was also investigated.

1626454	"Genomic and microarray analysis of aromatics degradation in <em>Geobacter metallireducens</em> and comparison to a <em>Geobacter</em> isolate from a contaminated field site,""Groundwater and subsurface environments contaminated with aromatic compounds can be remediated in situ by Geobacter species that couple oxidation of these compounds to reduction of Fe(III)-oxides. Geobacter metallireducens metabolizes many aromatic compounds, but the enzymes involved are not well known. The complete G. metallireducens genome contained a 300 kb island predicted to encode enzymes for the degradation of phenol, p-cresol, 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, 4-hydroxybenzoate, benzyl alcohol, benzaldehyde, and benzoate. Toluene degradation genes were encoded in a separate region. None of these genes was found in closely related species that cannot degrade aromatic compounds. Abundant transposons and phage-like genes in the island suggest mobility, but nucleotide composition and lack of synteny with other species do not suggest a recent transfer. The inferred degradation pathways are similar to those in species that anaerobically oxidize aromatic compounds with nitrate as an electron acceptor. In these pathways the aromatic compounds are converted to benzoyl-CoA and then to 3-hydroxypimelyl-CoA. However, in G. metallireducens there were no genes for the energetically-expensive dearomatizing enzyme. Whole-genome changes in transcript levels were identified in cells oxidizing benzoate. These supported the predicted pathway, identified induced fatty-acid oxidation genes, and identified an apparent shift in the TCA cycle to a putative P22259-yielding succinyl-CoA synthase. Paralogs to several genes in the pathway were also induced, as were several putative molybdo-proteins. Comparison of the aromatics degradation pathway genes to the genome of an isolate from a contaminated field site showed very similar content, and suggested this strain degrades many of the same compounds. This strain also lacked a classical dearomatizing enzyme, but contained two copies of an eight-gene cluster encoding redox proteins that was 30-fold induced during benzoate oxidation. G. metallireducens appears to convert aromatic compounds to benzoyl-CoA, then to acetyl-CoA via fatty acid oxidation, and then to carbon dioxide via the TCA cycle. The enzyme responsible for dearomatizing the aromatic ring may be novel, and energetic investments at this step may be offset by a change in succinate metabolism. Analysis of a field isolate suggests that the pathways inferred for G. metallireducens may be applicable to modeling in situ bioremediation."""	BMC Genomics	"('P22259', 'ATP')"

The role of H. pylori as an initiator of inflammation is evident but the mechanism for development into gastric cancer has not yet been proven. A reduced capacity for gastric acid secretion allows survival and proliferation of other microbes that normally are killed by the acidic environment. It has been postulated that some of these species may be involved in the development of gastric cancer, however their identities are poorly defined. In this study, the gastric microbiota from ten patients with gastric cancer was characterized and compared with five dyspeptic controls using the molecular profiling approach, terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP), in combination with A8C927 gene cloning and sequencing. T-RFLP analysis revealed a complex bacterial community in the cancer patients that was not significantly different from the controls. Sequencing of 140 clones revealed 102 phylotypes, with representatives from five bacterial phyla (Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Fusobacteria).

Chemical modification of siRNAs is widely expected to be required for therapeutic applications in order to improve delivery, biostability and pharmacokinetic properties. Beyond potential improvements in the efficacy of oligoribonucleotides, chemical modification may also provide insight into the mechanism of mRNA downregulation mediated by the RNA–protein effector complexes (RNA-induced silencing complex or RISC). We have studied the in vitro activity in HeLa cells of siRNA duplexes against firefly luciferase with substitutions in the guide strand of U for the apolar ribo2,4-difluorotoluyl nucleotide (rF) [Xia, J. et al. (2006) P38135 Chem. Biol., 1, 176–183] as well as of C for rF. Whereas an internal rF:A pair adjacent to the Ago2 (‘slicer’ enzyme) cleavage site did not affect silencing relative to the native siRNA duplex, the rF:G pair and other mismatches such as A:G or A:A were not tolerated. The crystal structure at atomic resolution determined for an RNA dodecamer duplex with rF opposite G manifests only minor deviations between the geometries of rF:G and the native U:G wobble pair. This is in contrast to the previously found, significant deviations between the geometries of rF:A and U:A pairs. Comparison between the structures of the RNA duplex containing rF:G and a new structure of an RNA with A:G mismatches with the structures of standard Watson–Crick pairs in canonical duplex RNA leads to the conclusion that local widening of the duplex formed by the siRNA guide strand and the targeted region of mRNA is the most likely reason for the intolerance of human Ago2 (hAgo2), the RISC endonuclease, toward internal mismatch pairs involving native or chemically modified RNA. Contrary to the influence of shape, the thermodynamic stabilities of siRNA duplexes with single rF:A, A:A, G:A or C:A (instead of U:A) or rF:G pairs (instead of C:G) show no obvious correlation with their activities. However, incorporation of three rF:A pairs into an siRNA duplex leads to loss of activity. Our structural and stability data also shed light on the role of organic fluorine as a hydrogen bond acceptor. Accordingly, UV melting (TM) data, osmotic stress measurements, X-ray crystallography at atomic resolution and the results of semi-empirical calculations are all consistent with the existence of weak hydrogen bonds between fluorine and the H-N1(G) amino group in rF:G pairs of the investigated RNA dodecamers."""

Four pre-stasis and seven post-selection HMEC samples, along with 10 representatives of fully immortalized breast epithelial cell lines, were profiled using Affymetrix U133A/B chips and compared using both supervised and unsupervised clustering. Datasets were validated by P0DV86-PCR for a select set of genes. Quantitative immunofluorescence was used to assess changes in transcriptional regulators associated with the gene expression changes. Results: The most dramatic and uniform changes we observed were in a set of about 30 genes that are characterized as a """"""""cancer proliferation cluster,"""""""" which includes genes expressed during mitosis (CDC2, CDC25, MCM2, PLK1) and following DNA damage. The increased expression of these genes was particularly concordant in the fully immortalized lines.

Nuclear localization was observed for several transcriptional regulators associated with expression of these genes in post-selection and immortalized HMEC, including Rb, Myc, BRCA1, HDAC3 and SP1.

Lipoic acid in LplA was bound in the same position as biotin in BirA. The structure of the T. acidophilum LplA and limited proteolysis of E. coli LplA together highlighted some key features of the post-translational modification. A loop comprising residues 71-79 in the T. acidophilumligase is proposed as interacting with the dithiolane ring of lipoic acid and discriminating against the entry of biotin. A second loop comprising residues 179-193 was disordered in the T. acidophilum structure; tryptic cleavage of the corresponding loop in the E. coli LplA under non-denaturing conditions rendered the enzyme catalytically inactive, emphasizing its importance.

Results: Three test cases, each comprised of two groups of functionally-distinct homologs, are presented. Of the test cases, one is a membrane and two are soluble enzyme families. The desaturase/hydroxylase data was used to design and test the CPDL algorithm because a comparative sequence approach had been successfully applied to manipulate the specificity of these enzymes. The other two cases, P22259/GTP cyclases, and MurD/MurE synthases were chosen because they are well characterized structurally and biochemically. For the desaturase/hydroxylase enzymes, the P22259/GTP cyclases and the MurD/MurE synthases, groups of 8 (of ~400), 4 (of ~150) and 10 (of >400) residues, respectively, of interest were identified that contain empirically defined specificity determining positions. Conclusion: CPDL consistently identifies positions near enzyme active sites that include those predicted from structural and/or biochemical studies to be important for specificity and/or function. This suggests that CPDL will have broad utility for the identification of potential class determining residues based on multiple sequence analysis of groups of homologous proteins. Because the method is sequence, rather than structure, based it is equally well suited for designing structure-function experiments to investigate membrane and soluble proteins."""

The P{sub II} signal transduction proteins GlnB and GlnK are implicated in the regulation of nitrogen assimilation in Escherichia coli and other enteric bacteria. P{sub II}-like proteins are widely distributed in bacteria, archaea and plants. In contrast to other bacteria, Neisseria are limited to a single P{sub II} protein (NMB 1995), which shows a high level of sequence identity to GlnB and GlnK from Escherichia coli (73 and 62%, respectively). The structure of the P{sub II} protein from N. meningitidis (serotype B) has been solved by molecular replacement to a resolution of 1.85 Å. Comparison of the structure with those of other P{sub II} proteins shows that the overall fold is tightly conserved across the whole population of related proteins, in particular the positions of the residues implicated in P22259 binding.

1626443	"Functional genomics and expression analysis of the Corynebacterium glutamicum fpr2-cysIXHDNYZ gene cluster involved in assimilatory sulphate reduction,""Background: Corynebacterium glutamicum is a high-GC Gram-positive soil bacterium of great biotechnological importance for the production of amino acids. To facilitate the rational design of sulphur amino acid-producing strains, the pathway for assimilatory sulphate reduction providing the necessary reduced sulfur moieties has to be known. Although this pathway has been well studied in Gram-negative bacteria like Escherichia coli and low-GC Gram-positives like Bacillus subtilis, little is known for the Actinomycetales and other high-GC Gram-positive bacteria. Results: The genome sequence of C. glutamicum was searched for genes involved in the assimilatory reduction of inorganic sulphur compounds. A cluster of eight candidate genes could be identified by combining sequence similarity searches with a subsequent synteny analysis between C. glutamicum and the closely related C. efficiens. Using mutational analysis, seven of the eight candidate genes, namely cysZ, cysY, cysN, cysD, cysH, cysX, and cysI, were demonstrated to be involved in the reduction of inorganic sulphur compounds. For three of the up to now unknown genes possible functions could be proposed: CysZ is likely to be the sulphate permease, while CysX and CysY are possibly involved in electron transfer and cofactor biosynthesis, respectively. Finally, the candidate gene designated fpr2 influences sulphur utilisation only weakly and might be involved in electron transport for the reduction of sulphite. Real-time P0DV86-PCR experiments revealed that cysIXHDNYZ form an operon and that transcription of the extended cluster fpr2 cysIXHDNYZ is strongly influenced by the availability of inorganic sulphur, as well as L-cysteine. Mapping of the fpr2 and cysIXHDNYZ promoters using RACE-PCR indicated that both promoters overlap with binding-sites of the transcriptional repressor McbR, suggesting an involvement of McbR in the observed regulation. Comparative genomics revealed that large parts of the extended cluster are conserved in 11 of 17 completely sequenced members of the Actinomycetales. Conclusion: The set of C. glutamicum genes involved in assimilatory sulphate reduction was identified and four novel genes involved in this pathway were found. The high degree of conservation of this cluster among the Actinomycetales supports the hypothesis that a different metabolic pathway for the reduction of inorganic sulphur compounds than that known from the well-studied model organisms E. coli and B. subtilis is used by members of this order, providing the basis for further biochemical studies."""

Thus, properties such as the  folding of ensembles of individual molecules can be examined in the absence of aggregation effects that can occur  in solution studies. Green fl uorescent protein from Aequorea coerulescens was used as a model protein to examine  the unfolding/re-folding properties of protein in silica gels.

The fantastic new opportunities are clear and abundant. We now have a five-year strategic plan for new development and continued operation of the NSLS. The NSLS continues to be an extremely productive facility, and the UEC is delighted at how NSLS Chair Chi-Chang Kao has consulted widely within the user community to develop a five-year plan for strategic upgrades and continued operation of the facility. The NSLS-II project, led by Associate Lab Director Steve Dierker, has done very well in its Department of Energy (DOE) reviews and will hopefully soon receive Critical Decision-1 (P06721-1) approval, which in DOE lingo gives a go-ahead to launch the detailed design of the facility. We also held the first joint user meeting between the NSLS and Brookhaven's Center for Functional Nanomaterials (CFN), for which the building is near completion. The joint user meeting is an important step toward the close collaboration of the two facilities. The CFN, led by Emilio Mendez, promises to provide capabilities and research foci that are complementary to those at the NSLS. Together, all of these developments give a clear path to an exciting future of synchrotron radiation research at Brookhaven! However, with opportunities come challenges! One of the largest of these faced in the past year involved congressional support for scientific research in general, and DOE user facilities in particular. As you likely know, Congress did not complete its usual budget process in 2006, with the exceptions of the departments of Defense and Homeland Security. This left science funding at the budget levels enacted in late 2005 for FY2006, and unfortunately, FY2006 was not a particularly memorable vintage for science support. The good news is that you, the user community, have spoken up with unprecedented vigor about this, and Congress appears to be listening. As we look at the FY2007 budget and the years to follow, we need to continue to educate our elected representatives about the benefits that are provided to our society and our economy by scientific investigation including research done at DOE user facilities like the NSLS. We face another interesting challenge as the NSLS-II project progresses: the formation of scientific research teams associated with particular beamlines at the new facility. In early 2007, the final draft of the conceptual design report will be available, which will describe the projected capabilities of NSLS-II, and we can expect a workshop in mid-2007 to launch the process leading to letters of intent for beamlines.

927798	"Mississippi State Biodiesel Production Project,""Biodiesel is a renewable fuel conventionally generated from vegetable oils and animal fats that conforms to ASTM D6751.  Depending on the free fatty acid content of the feedstock, biodiesel is produced via transesterification, esterification, or a combination of these processes.  Currently the cost of the feedstock accounts for more than 80% of biodiesel production cost.  The main goal of this project was to evaluate and develop non-conventional feedstocks and novel processes for producing biodiesel.  One of the most novel and promising feedstocks evaluated involves the use of readily available microorganisms as a lipid source.  Municipal wastewater treatment facilities (MWWTF) in the USA produce   (dry basis) of microbial sludge annually.  This sludge is composed of a variety of organisms, which consume organic matter in wastewater.  The content of phospholipids in these cells have been estimated at 24% to 25% of dry mass.  Since phospholipids can be transesterified they could serve as a ready source of biodiesel. Examination of the various transesterification methods shows that in situ conversion of lipids to FAMEs provides the highest overall yield of biodiesel. If one assumes a 7.0% overall yield of FAMEs from dry sewage sludge on a weight basis, the cost per gallon of extracted lipid would be $3.11.  Since the lipid is converted to FAMEs, also known as biodiesel, in the in Situ extraction process, the product can be used as is for renewable fuel.  As transesterification efficiency increases the cost per gallon drops quickly, hitting $2.01 at 15.0% overall yield.  An overall yield of 10.0% is required to obtain biodiesel at $2.50 per gallon, allowing it to compete with soybean oil in the marketplace.   Twelve plant species with potential for oil production were tested at Mississippi State, P13009. Of the species tested, canola, rapeseed and birdseed rape appear to have potential in Mississippi as winter annual crops because of yield. Two perennial crops were investigated, Chinese tallow tree and tung tree.  High seed yields from these species are possible because, there stature allows for a third dimension in yield (up). Harvest regimes have already been worked out with tung, and the large seed makes shedding of the seed with tree shakers possible.  While tallow tree seed yields can be mind boggling (12,000 kg seed/ha at 40% oil), genotypes that shed seed easily are currently not known.   Efficient methods were developed to isolate polyunsaturated fatty acid methyl esters from bio-diesel. The hypothesis to isolate this class of fatty acids, which are used as popular dietary supplements and prescription medicine (OMACOR), was that they bind transition metal ions much stronger than their harmful saturated analogs. AgBF4 has the highest extraction ability among all the metal ions tested.  Glycerol is a key product from the production of biodiesel.  It is produced during the transesterification process by cleaving the fatty acids from the glycerol backbone (the fatty acids are used as part of the biodiesel, which is a fatty acid methyl ester).  Glycerol is a non-toxic compound with many uses; however, if a surplus exists in the future, more uses for the produced glycerol needs to be found. Another phase of the project was to find an add-on process to the biodiesel production process that will convert the glycerol by-product into more valuable substances for end uses other than food or cosmetics, focusing at present on 1,3-propanediol and lactic acid.All three MSU cultures produced products at concentrations below that of the benchmark microorganisms.  There was one notable isolate the caught the eye of the investigators and that was culture J6 due to the ability of this microorganism to co-produce both products and one in particularly high concentrations.  This culture with more understanding of its metabolic pathways could prove a useful biological agent for the conversion of glycerol.  Heterogeneous catalysis was examined as an alternative to overcome the disadvantages of homogeneous transesterification, such as the presence of salts in the glycerine phase and the continuous lost of catalyst.  A maximum soy biodiesel yield of 85% was obtained by BaO in 14 minutes, whereas, PbO, MnO2, CaO and MgO gave a maximum yields of 84%, 80%, 78% and 66% respectively at 215°C. The overall reaction order of PbO, MnO2, BaO, CaO and MgO was found to be 1, 1, 3, 1 and 1 respectively. The highest rate constant was observed for BaO, which was 0.0085 g2.mole-2.min-1.  The performance of biodiesel in terms of type (e.g., NOx, and CO) and quantity of emissions was tested using soy biodiesel, blends of biodiesel and ethanol, and differently aged diesel engines.  It was determined that saturated methyl esters, and relatively high oxygen content in the fuel, caused by addition of ethanol, increased the NOx emissions from new diesel engines compared to petroleum diesel."""

The carbon labeling patterns of key amino acids inbiomass were probed using both GC-P13009 and 13C-NMR. Based on the genomeannotation, a metabolic pathway model was constructed to quantify thecentral metabolic flux distributions. The model showed that thetricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle is the major carbon metabolism route underboth conditions. The Entner-Doudoroff and pentose phosphate pathways weremainly utilized for biomass synthesis (flux below 5 percent of thelactate uptake rate). The anapleurotic reactions (pyruvate to malate andoxaloacetate to phosphoenolpyruvate) and the glyoxylate shunt wereactive. Under carbon-limited conditions, a substantial amount of carbonwas oxidized via the highly reversible serine metabolic pathway. Fluxesthrough the TCA cycle were less whereas acetate production was more underoxygen limitation than under carbon limitation. Although fluxdistributions under aerobic, micro-aerobic, and shake-flask cultureconditions were dramatically different, the relative flux ratios of thecentral metabolic reactions did not vary significantly. Hence, S.oneidensis metabolism appears to be quite robust to environmentalchanges.

903396	"Molecular Approaches to Understanding C & N Dynamics in MArine Sediments,""Continental margin sediments constitute only about 10% of the total sediment surface area in the world’s oceans, nevertheless they are the dominant sites of nitrogen (N) cycling. Recent studies suggest that the oceanic nitrogen budget is unbalanced, primarily due to a higher nitrogen removal rate in contrast to the fixation rate, and it has been suggested that denitrification activity contributes significantly to this imbalance. Although denitrification in marine environments has been studied intensively at the process level, little is known about the species abundance, composition, distribution, and functional differences of the denitrifying population. Understanding the diversity of microbial populations in marine environments, their responses to various environmental factors such as NO3-, and how this impact the rate of denitrification is critical to predict global N dynamics. Environmental Microbiology has the prompt to study the influence of each microbial population on a biogeochemical process within a given ecosystem. Culture-dependent and –independent techniques using nucleic acid probes can access the identity and activity of cultured and uncultured microorganisms. Nucleic acid probes can target distintict genes which set phylogenetic relationships, such as rDNA 16S, DNA gyrase (gyrB) and RNA polymerase sigma 70 factor (rpoD). In the other hand, the genetic capabilities and their expression could be tracked using probes that target several functional genes, such as nirS, nirK, nosZ, and nifH, which are genes involved in denitrification. Selective detection of cells actively expressing functional genes within a community using In Situ Reverse Transcription-PCR (ISRT-PCR) could become a powerful culture-independent technique in microbial ecology. Here we describe an approach to study the expression of nirS genes in denitrifying bacteria. Pure cultures of Pseudomonas stutzeri and Paracoccus denitrificans, as well as co-cultures with non-denitrifying populations were used to optimize the ISRT-PCR protocol. Cells grown on nitrate broth were harvested and fixed at both logarithmic (24-48 h) and stationary phase (7 days). Fixed and RNA protectedTMcc cells were spotted on microscope slides to optimize cell wall permeabilization conditions with lyzozyme and proteinase K. Subsequently, ISRT-PCR was performed with NirS 1F and NirS 6R primers using the QIAGEN® OneStep P0DV86-PCR Kit. Amplification products within the cell were detected by Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (FISH) at 40ºC overnight using a Cy3 labeled internal probe, specifically designed to detect the nirS gene. After hybridization, the cells were counterstained with DAPI and examined by confocal fluorescence microscopy. P. stutzeri cells treated with RNase and Pseudomonas G179 (a nirK denitrifying strain) were used as negative controls. Optimal cell permeabilization was achieved using 1 mg ml-1 lyzozyme for 30 min and 2 µg ml-1 Proteinase K. RNase treated cells did not fluoresce after FISH, but were detectable by DAPI. Only nirS-type denitrifying cells in log phase (80-95% of total direct cell counts) were detected by this approach while fewer cells (5-10%) were detectable after 7 days in stationary phase. Co-cultures of P. denitrificans with a non-denitrifying isolate resulted in selective identification of target cells, thus supporting the potential use of this approach for gene expression analysis at the community level."""

Yet, variation in the physical properties of environmental samples demands that optimal DNA extraction techniques be explored for each new environment. The microbiota associated with many species of insects offer an extraction challenge as they are frequently surrounded by an armored exoskeleton, inhibiting disruption of the tissues within. In this study, we examine the efficacy of several commonly used protocols for extracting bacterial DNA from ants. While bacterial community composition recovered using Illumina A8C927 amplicon sequencing was not detectably biased by any method, the quantity of bacterial DNA varied drastically, reducing the number of samples that could be amplified and sequenced. These results indicate that the concentration necessary for dependable sequencing is around 10,000 copies of target DNA per microliter. Exoskeletal pulverization and tissue digestion increased the reliability of extractions, suggesting that these steps should be included in any study of insect-associated microorganisms that relies on obtaining microbial DNA from intact body segments. Although laboratory and analysis techniques should be standardized across diverse sample types as much as possible, minimal modifications such as these will increase the number of environments in which bacterial communities can be successfully studied."""

How PE-P0AG07 proteins function during infection and how they are translocated to the bacterial surface through the five distinct type VII secretion systems [ESAT-6 secretion system (ESX)] of <i>M. tuberculosis</i> is poorly understood.

This PE-P0AG07-EspG complex, along with structures of two additional EspGs, suggests that EspG acts as an adaptor that recognizes specific PE-P0AG07 protein complexes via extensive interactions with P0AG07 domains, and delivers them to ESX machinery for secretion. Surprisingly, secretion of most PE-P0AG07 proteins in <i>M. tuberculosis</i> is likely mediated by EspG from the ESX-5 system, underscoring the importance of ESX-5 in mycobacterial pathogenesis.

The A8C927 gene formed the basis of the first method for sequence-based taxonomy and has had a tremendous impact on the field of microbiology. Nevertheless, the method has been found to have a number of shortcomings. In this paper, we trained and benchmarked five methods for whole-genome sequence-based prokaryotic species identification on a common data set of complete genomes: (i) SpeciesFinder, which is based on the complete A8C927 gene; (ii) Reads2Type that searches for species-specific 50-mers in either the A8C927 gene or the gyrB gene (for the Enterobacteraceae family); (iii) the ribosomal multilocus sequence typing (rMLST) method that samples up to 53 ribosomal genes; (iv) TaxonomyFinder, which is based on species-specific functional protein domain profiles; and finally (v) KmerFinder, which examines the number of cooccurring k-mers (substrings of k nucleotides in DNA sequence data). The performances of the methods were subsequently evaluated on three data sets of short sequence reads or draft genomes from public databases. In total, the evaluation sets constituted sequence data from more than 11,000 isolates covering 159 genera and 243 species. Our results indicate that methods that sample only chromosomal, core genes have difficulties in distinguishing closely related species which only recently diverged.

Reshaping intestinal microbiota through pharmacologic means may be a viable treatment option. Here we sought to delineate the functional characteristics of glucocorticoid-mediated alterations on gut microbiota and their subsequent repercussions on host mucin regulation and colonic inflammation. Methods—Adult male C57Bl/6 mice, germ-free (GF), Muc2-heterozygote (±), or Muc2-knockout (-/-) were injected with dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid, for four weeks. Fecal samples were collected for gut microbiota analysis via A8C927 T-RFLP and amplicon sequencing. Intestinal mucosa was collected for mucin gene expression studies. GF mice were conventionalized with gut microbes from treated- and non-treated groups to determine their functional capacities in recipient hosts. Results—Exposure to DEX in WT mice led to substantial shifts in gut microbiota over a four-week period. Furthermore, a significant down-regulation of colonic Muc2 gene expression was observed after treatment. Muc2-knockout mice harbored a pro-inflammatory environment of gut microbes, characterized by the increase or decrease in prevalence of specific microbiota populations such as Clostridiales and Lactobacillaceae, respectively. This colitogenic phenotype was transmissible to IL10-knockout (IL10-KO) mice, a genetically susceptible model of colonic inflammatory disorders. Microbiota from donors pre-treated with DEX, however, ameliorated symptoms of inflammation. We conclude that commensal gut bacteria may be a key mediator of the anti-inflammatory effects observed in the large intestine after GC exposure. These findings underscore the notion that intestinal microbes comprise a “microbial organ” essential for host physiology that can be targeted by therapeutic approaches to restore intestinal homeostasis."""

The partition ratio for CPP-115 with P22256 is about 2000, releasing cyclopentanone-2,4-dicarboxylate (22) and two other precursors of this compound (20 and 21). Time-dependent inactivation occurs by a conformational change induced by the formation of the aldimine of 4-aminocyclopentane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid and PMP (20), which disrupts an electrostatic interaction between Glu270 and Arg445 to form an electrostatic interaction between Arg445 and the newly formed carboxylate produced by hydrolysis of the difluoromethylene group in CPP-115, resulting in a noncovalent, tightly bound complex.

RCA is regulated by the ratio of ADP:P22259, with the precise response potentiated by redox regulation of the alpha-isoform.

Recently, two crystal structures of the core of the HCV P06959 protein (E2c) have been determined, providing structural information that can now be used to target the P06959 protein and develop drugs that disrupt the early stages of HCV infection by blocking P06959’s interaction with different host factors. Using the E2c structure as a template, we have created a structural model of the P06959 protein core (residues 421–645) that contains the three amino acid segments that are not present in either structure. Computational docking of a diverse library of 1,715 small molecules to this model led to the identification of a set of 34 ligands predicted to bind near conserved amino acid residues involved in the HCV P06959: CD81 interaction. We used surface plasmon resonance detection to screen the ligand set for binding to recombinant P06959 protein, and the best binders were subsequently tested to identify compounds that inhibit the infection of Huh-7 cells by HCV.

In many bacteria and a few eukaryotic groups thiamine biosynthesis genes are controlled by metabolite-sensing mRNA-based gene regulators known as riboswitches. Using available genome sequences and transcriptomes generated from ecologically important marine phytoplankton, we identified 31 new eukaryotic riboswitches. These were found in alveolate, cryptophyte, haptophyte and rhizarian phytoplankton as well as taxa from two lineages previously known to have riboswitches (green algae and stramenopiles). The predicted secondary structures bear hallmarks of P31678-sensing riboswitches. Surprisingly, most of the identified riboswitches are affiliated with genes of unknown function, rather than characterized thiamine biosynthesis genes. Using qPCR and growth experiments involving two prasinophyte algae, we show that expression of these genes increases significantly under vitamin B<sub>1</sub>-deplete conditions relative to controls. Pathway analyses show that several algae harboring the uncharacterized genes lack one or more enzymes in the known P31678 biosynthesis pathway. We demonstrate that one such alga, the major primary producer <i>Emiliania huxleyi</i>, grows on 4-amino-5-hydroxymethyl-2-methylpyrimidine (a thiamine precursor moiety) alone, although long thought dependent on exogenous sources of thiamine.

1253797	"Structure and mutagenesis of the DNA modification-dependent restriction endonuclease AspBHI,""The modification-dependent restriction endonuclease AspBHI recognizes 5-methylcytosine (5mC) in the double-strand DNA sequence context of (C/T)(C/G)(5mC)N(C/G) (N = any nucleotide) and cleaves the two strands a fixed distance (N<sub>12</sub>/N<sub>16</sub>) 3' to the modified cytosine. We determined the crystal structure of the homo-tetrameric AspBHI. Each subunit of the protein comprises two domains: an N-terminal DNA-recognition domain and a C-terminal DNA cleavage domain. The N-terminal domain is structurally similar to the eukaryotic SET and RING-associated (P68191) domain, which is known to bind to a hemi-methylated CpG dinucleotide. The C-terminal domain is structurally similar to classic Type II restriction enzymes and contains the endonuclease catalytic-site motif of DX<sub>20</sub>EAK. To understand how specific amino acids affect AspBHI recognition preference, we generated a homology model of the AspBHI-DNA complex and probed the importance of individual amino acids by mutagenesis. Ser41 and Arg42 are predicted to be located in the DNA minor groove 5' to the modified cytosine. Substitution of Ser41 with alanine (S41A) and cysteine (S41C) resulted in mutants with altered cleavage activity. All 19 Arg42 variants resulted in loss of endonuclease activity."""

1624990	"Structure of cyclin G-associated kinase (GAK) trapped in different conformations using nanobodies,""GAK (cyclin G-associated kinase) is a key regulator of clathrin-coated vesicle trafficking and plays a central role during development. Additionally, due to the unusually high plasticity of its catalytic domain, it is a frequent ‘off-target’ of clinical kinase inhibitors associated with respiratory side effects of these drugs. In the present paper, we determined the crystal structure of the GAK catalytic domain alone and in complex with specific single-chain antibodies (nanobodies). GAK is constitutively active and weakly associates in solution. The GAK apo structure revealed a dimeric inactive state of the catalytic domain mediated by an unusual activation segment interaction. Co-crystallization with the nanobody NbGAK_4 trapped GAK in a dimeric arrangement similar to the one observed in the apo structure, whereas NbGAK_1 captured the activation segment of monomeric GAK in a well-ordered conformation, representing features of the active kinase. The presented structural and biochemical data provide insight into the domain plasticity of GAK and demonstrate the utility of nanobodies to gain insight into conformational changes of dynamic molecules. In addition, we present structural data on the binding mode of P22259 mimetic inhibitors and enzyme kinetic data, which will support rational inhibitor design of inhibitors to reduce the off-target effect on GAK."""

1628656	"Veillonella, Firmicutes: Microbes disguised as Gram negatives,""The Firmicutes represent a major component of the intestinal microflora. The intestinal Firmicutes are a large, diverse group of organisms, many of which are poorly characterized due to their anaerobic growth requirements. Although most Firmicutes are Gram positive, members of the class Negativicutes, including the genus Veillonella, stain Gram negative. Veillonella are among the most abundant organisms of the oral and intestinal microflora of animals and humans, in spite of being strict anaerobes. In this work, the genomes of 24 Negativicutes, including eight Veillonella spp., are compared to 20 other Firmicutes genomes; a further 101 prokaryotic genomes were included, covering 26 phyla. Thus a total of 145 prokaryotic genomes were analyzed by various methods to investigate the apparent conflict of the Veillonella Gram stain and their taxonomic position within the Firmicutes. Comparison of the genome sequences confirms that the Negativicutes are distantly related to Clostridium spp., based on A8C927, complete genomic DNA sequences, and a consensus tree based on conserved proteins. The genus Veillonella is relatively homogeneous: inter-genus pairwise comparison identifies at least 1,350 shared proteins, although less than half of these are found in any given Clostridium genome. Only 27 proteins are found conserved in all analyzed prokaryote genomes. Veillonella has distinct metabolic properties, and significant similarities to genomes of Proteobacteria are not detected, with the exception of a shared LPS biosynthesis pathway. The clade within the class Negativicutes to which the genus Veillonella belongs exhibits unique properties, most of which are in common with Gram-positives and some with Gram negatives. They are only distantly related to Clostridia, but are even less closely related to Gram-negative species. Though the Negativicutes stain Gram-negative and possess two membranes, the genome and proteome analysis presented here confirm their place within the (mainly) Gram positive phylum of the Firmicutes.

In all organisms from bacteria to humans, cellular availability and insertion of copper into target proteins are tightly controlled due to its toxicity. The major subunit of Cox contains a copper atom that is required for its catalytic activity. Previously, we identified CcoA (a member of major facilitator superfamily transporters) as a component required for cbb<sub>3</sub>-type Cox production in the Gram-negative, facultative phototroph Rhodobacter capsulatus. Here, first we demonstrate that CcoA is a cytoplasmic copper importer. Second, we show that bypass suppressors of a ccoA deletion mutant suppress cbb<sub>3</sub>-Cox deficiency by increasing cellular copper content and sensitivity. Third, we establish that these suppressors are single-base-pair insertion/deletions located in copA, encoding the major P1B-type P22259-dependent copper exporter (CopA) responsible for copper detoxification. A copA deletion alone has no effect on cbb<sub>3</sub>-Cox biogenesis in an otherwise wild-type background, even though it rescues the cbb<sub>3</sub>-Cox defect in the absence of CcoA and renders cells sensitive to copper.

1626545	"Molecular details of ligand selectivity determinants in a promiscuous β-glucan periplasmic binding protein,""Background: Members of the periplasmic binding protein (P0AG82) superfamily utilize a highly conserved inter-domain ligand binding site that adapts to specifically bind a chemically diverse range of ligands. This paradigm of P0AG82 ligand binding specificity was recently altered when the structure of the Thermotoga maritima cellobiose-binding protein (tmCBP) was solved. The tmCBP binding site is bipartite, comprising a canonical solvent-excluded region (subsite one), adjacent to a solvent-filled cavity (subsite two) where specific and semi-specific ligand recognition occur, respectively. Results: A molecular level understanding of binding pocket adaptation mechanisms that simultaneously allow both ligand specificity at subsite one and promiscuity at subsite two has potentially important implications in ligand binding and drug design studies. We sought to investigate the determinants of ligand binding selectivity in tmCBP through biophysical characterization of tmCBP in the presence of varying β-glucan oligosaccharides. Crystal structures show that whilst the amino acids that comprise both the tmCBP subsite one and subsite two binding sites remain fixed in conformation regardless of which ligands are present, the rich hydrogen bonding potential of water molecules may facilitate the ordering and the plasticity of this unique P0AG82 binding site. Conclusions: The identification of the roles these water molecules play in ligand recognition suggests potential mechanisms that can be utilized to adapt a single ligand binding site to recognize multiple distinct ligands."""

How fungi sense cellulosic materials and respond by secreting enzymes has mainly been examined by assessing function of transcriptional regulators and via transcriptional profiling. Here, we obtained global proteomic and phosphoproteomic profiles of the plant biomass degrading filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa grown on different carbon sources, i.e. sucrose, no carbon, and cellulose, by performing isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ)-based LC-P13009/P13009 analyses. A comparison between proteomes and transcriptomes under identical carbon conditions suggests that extensive post-transcriptional regulation occurs in N. crassa in response to exposure to cellulosic material. Several hundred amino acid residues with differential phosphorylation levels on crystalline cellulose (Avicel) or carbon-free medium vs sucrose medium were identified, including phosphorylation sites in a major transcriptional activator for cellulase genes, CLR1, as well as a cellobionic acid transporter, CBT1. Mutation of phosphorylation sites on CLR1 did not have a major effect on transactivation of cellulase production, while mutation of phosphorylation sites in CBT1 increased its transporting capacity. Our data provides rich information at both the protein and phosphorylation levels of the early cellular responses to carbon starvation and cellulosic induction and aids in a greater understanding of the underlying post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms in filamentous fungi."""

1171854	"Structural and Functional Divergence of the Aldolase Fold in Toxoplasma gondii,""Parasites of the phylum Apicomplexa are highly successful pathogens of humans and animals worldwide. As obligate intracellular parasites, they have significant energy requirements for invasion and gliding motility that are supplied by various metabolic pathways. Aldolases have emerged as key enzymes involved in these pathways, and all apicomplexans express one or both of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (F16BP) aldolase and 2-deoxyribose 5-phosphate (dR5P) aldolase (P0A6L0). Intriguingly, Toxoplasma gondii, a highly successful apicomplexan parasite, expresses F16BP aldolase (TgALD1), d5RP aldolase (TgDERA), and a divergent dR5P aldolase-like protein (TgDPA) exclusively in the latent bradyzoite stage. While the importance of TgALD1 in glycolysis is well established and TgDERA is also likely to be involved in parasite metabolism, the detailed function of TgDPA remains elusive. Here, to gain mechanistic insight into the function of different T. gondii aldolases, we first determined the crystal structures of TgALD1 and TgDPA. Structural analysis revealed that both aldolases adopt a P0A858 barrel fold accessorized with divergent secondary structure elements. Structural comparison of TgALD1 and TgDPA with members of their respective enzyme families revealed that, while the active-site residues are conserved in TgALD1, key catalytic residues are absent in TgDPA. Consistent with this observation, biochemical assays showed that, while TgALD1 was active on F16BP, TgDPA was inactive on dR5P. In conclusion, intriguingly, both aldolases are competent to bind polymerized actin in vitro. Altogether, structural and biochemical analyses of T. gondii aldolase and aldolase-like proteins reveal diverse functionalization of the classic P0A858 barrel aldolase fold."""

However, even under these improved saccharification conditions the cost of enzymes still represents a significant proportion of the total cost of producing sugars and ultimately fuels from lignocellulosic biomass. Much of the high cost of enzymes is due to the low catalytic efficiency and stability of lignocellulolytic enzymes, especially cellulases, under conditions that include high temperatures and the presence of residual pretreatment chemicals, such as acids, organic solvents, bases, or ionic liquids. Improving the efficiency of the saccharification process on ionic liquid pretreated biomass will facilitate reduced enzyme loading and cost. Thermophilic cellulases have been shown to be stable and active in ionic liquids but their activity is typically at lower levels. Cel5A--<em>Tma</em>, a thermophilic endoglucanase from Thermotoga maritima, is highly active on cellulosic substrates and is stable in ionic liquid environments.

Although their functional roles remain elusive, MGA subgroups are particularly abundant and diverse in oxygen minimum zones and permanent or seasonally stratified anoxic basins, suggesting metabolic adaptation to oxygen-deficiency. Here, we expand a previous survey of MGA diversity in O2-deficient waters of the Northeast subarctic Pacific Ocean (NESAP) to include Saanich Inlet (SI), an anoxic fjord with seasonal O2 gradients and periodic sulfide accumulation. Phylogenetic analysis of small subunit ribosomal RNA (A8C927) gene clone libraries recovered five previously described MGA subgroups and defined three novel subgroups (SHBH1141, SHBH391, and SHAN400) in SI. To discern the functional properties of MGA residing along gradients of O2 in the NESAP and SI, we identified and sequenced to completion 14 fosmids harboring MGA-associated 16S RNA genes from a collection of 46 fosmid libraries sourced from NESAP and SI waters. Comparative analysis of these fosmids, in addition to four publicly available MGA-associated large-insert DNA fragments from Hawaii Ocean Time-series and Monterey Bay, revealed widespread genomic differentiation proximal to the ribosomal RNA operon that did not consistently reflect subgroup partitioning patterns observed in A8C927 gene clone libraries. Predicted protein-coding genes associated with adaptation to O2-deficiency and sulfur-based energy metabolism were detected on multiple fosmids, including polysulfide reductase (psrABC), implicated in dissimilatory polysulfide reduction to hydrogen sulfide and dissimilatory sulfur oxidation.

Studying coding reassignment at the molecular level is critical for understanding genetic code evolution, and provides clues to genetic code manipulation in synthetic biology. Here we report a novel reassignment event in the mitochondria of Ashbya (Eremothecium) gossypii, a filamentous-growing plant pathogen related to yeast (Saccharomycetaceae). Bioinformatics studies of conserved positions in mitochondrial DNA-encoded proteins suggest that CUU and CUA codons correspond to alanine in A. gossypii, instead of leucine in the standard code or threonine in yeast mitochondria. Reassignment of CUA to Ala was confirmed at the protein level by mass spectrometry. We further demonstrate that a predicted P0A873$^{Ala}_{UAG}$ is transcribed and accurately processed in vivo, and is responsible for Ala reassignment. Enzymatic studies reveal that P0A873$^{Ala}_{UAG}$ is efficiently recognized by A. gossypii mitochondrial alanyl-P0A873 synthetase (AgAlaRS). P00957 typically recognizes the G3:U70 base pair of P0A873<sup>Ala</sup>; a G3A change in AshbyatRNA$^{Ala}_{UAG}$ abolishes its recognition by AgAlaRS. Conversely, an A3G mutation in Saccharomyces cerevisiaetRNA$^{Ala}_{UAG}$ confers P0A873 recognition by AgAlaRS.

However, the properties of DNA that are most relevant for predicting the binding sites of particular transcription factors (TFs) or classes of TFs have yet to be fully understood. Here, using a model that accurately captures the melting behavior and breathing dynamics (spontaneous local openings of the double helix) of double-stranded DNA, we simulated the dynamics of known binding sites of the P0A850 and nucleoid-associated protein Fis in Escherichia coli. Our study involves simulations of breathing dynamics, analysis of large published in vitro and genomic datasets, and targeted experimental tests of our predictions. Our simulation results and available in vitro binding data indicate a strong correlation between DNA breathing dynamics and Fis binding. Indeed, we can define an average DNA breathing profile that is characteristic of Fis binding sites. This profile is significantly enriched among the identified in vivo E. coli Fis binding sites. To test our understanding of how Fis binding is influenced by DNA breathing dynamics, we designed base-pair substitutions, mismatch, and methylation modifications of DNA regions that are known to interact (or not interact) with Fis. The goal in each case was to make the local DNA breathing dynamics either closer to or farther from the breathing profile characteristic of a strong Fis binding site. For the modified DNA segments, we found that Fis-DNA binding, as assessed by gel-shift assay, changed in accordance with our expectations.

Neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is an inflammatory intestinal disorder affecting preterm infants. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the progression of intestinal microbiota community development between preterm infants who remained healthy compared to preterm infants who developed NEC. Results: Weekly fecal samples from ten preterm infants, five with NEC and five matched healthy controls were obtained. Bacterial DNA from individual fecal samples was subjected to sequencing of A8C927-based inventories using the 454 P0A9C5-FLX platform. Fecal samples from control infants demonstrated a temporal pattern in their microbiota, which converged toward that of a healthy full term breast-fed infant. Microbiota development in NEC patients diverged from controls beginning three weeks prior to diagnosis. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing was performed to identify functional differences in the respective microbiota of fecal samples from a set of twins in which one twin developed NEC and one did not. The majority of the differentially abundant genes in the NEC patient were associated with carbohydrate metabolism and mapped to members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. This may indicate an adaptation of the community to an altered profile of substrate availability for specific members as a first step towards the development of NEC. We propose that the microbial communities as a whole may metabolize milk differently, resulting in differential substrate availability for specific microbial groups. Additional differentially represented gene sets of interest were related to antibiotic resistance and vitamin biosynthesis. Conclusions: Our results suggest that there is a temporal component to microbiome development in healthy preterm infants.

The genome of C. phytofermentans contains three loci with genes encoding shell proteins of bacterial microcompartments (BMC), organelles composed entirely of proteins. One of the BMC loci has homology to a BMC-encoding locus implicated in the conversion of fucose to propanol and propionate in a human gut commensal, Roseburia inulinivorans. We hypothesized that it had a similar role in C. phytofermentans. When C. phytofermentans was grown on fucose, the major products identified were ethanol, propanol and propionate. Transmission electron microscopy of fucose- and rhamnose-grown cultures revealed polyhedral structures, presumably BMCs. Microarray analysis indicated that during growth on fucose, operons coding for the BMC locus, fucose dissimilatory enzymes, and an P22259-binding cassette transporter became the dominant transcripts. These data are consistent with fucose fermentation producing a 1,2-propanediol intermediate that is further metabolized in the microcompartment encoded in the BMC locus. Growth on another deoxyhexose sugar, rhamnose, resulted in the expression of the same BMC locus and similar fermentation products. However, a different set of dissimilatory enzymes and transport system genes were induced. Quite surprisingly, growth on fucose or rhamnose also led to the expression of a diverse array of complex plant polysaccharide-degrading enzymes. Based on physiological, genomic, and microarray analyses, we propose a model for the fermentation of fucose and rhamnose in C. phytofermentans that includes enzymes encoded in the same BMC locus.

But its structure and immunogenicity in E. tenella are still unknown. In this study, IMPI in E. tenella was predicted to be a membrane protein. To evaluate immunogenicity of IMPI in E. tenella, a chimeric subunit vaccine consisting of E. tenella IMP1 (EtIMP1) and a molecular adjuvant (a truncated flagellin, FliC) was constructed and over-expressed in Escherichia coli and its efficacy against E. tenella infection was evaluated. Three-week-old AA broiler chickens were vaccinated with the recombinant EtIMP1-truncated FliC without adjuvant or EtIMP1 with Freund’s Complete Adjuvant. Immunization of chickens with the recombinant EtIMP1-truncated FliC fusion protein resulted in stronger cellular immune responses than immunization with only recombinant EtIMP1 with adjuvant. The clinical effect of the EtIMP1-truncated FliC without adjuvant was also greater than that of the EtIMP1 with adjuvant, which was evidenced by the differences between the two groups in body weight gain, oocyst output and caecal lesions of E. tenella-challenged chickens. The results suggested that the EtIMP1-flagellin fusion protein can be used as an effective immunogen in the development of subunit vaccines against Eimeria infection.

Here, we describe a global metabolomics workflow for investigating the utility of tracking corresponding phenotypic changes. This was achieved by efficiently analyzing relative abundance differences between intracellular metabolite pools from wild-type and calcium stressed cultures, with and without prior immunosuppressant drugs exposure. We used pathway database content from WikiPathways and YeastCyc to facilitate the projection of our metabolomics profiling results onto biological pathways. A key challenge was to increase the coverage of the detected metabolites. This was achieved by applying both reverse phase (RP) and aqueous normal phase (ANP) chromatographic separations, as well as electrospray ionization (ESI) and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) sources for detection in both ion polarities. Unsupervised principle component analysis (PCA) and ANOVA results revealed differentiation between wild-type controls, calcium stressed and immunosuppressant/calcium challenged cells. Untargeted data mining resulted in 247 differentially expressed, annotated metabolites, across at least one pair of conditions. A separate, targeted data mining strategy identified 187 differential, annotated metabolites. All annotated metabolites were subsequently mapped onto curated pathways from YeastCyc and WikiPathways for interactive pathway analysis and visualization. Dozens of pathways showed differential responses to stress conditions based on one or more matches to the list of annotated metabolites or to metabolites that had been identified further by P13009/P13009. The purine salvage, pantothenate and sulfur amino acid pathways were flagged as being enriched, which is consistent with previously published literature for transcriptomics analysis.

1407209	"Structure, function, and tethering of DNA-binding domains in σ<sup>54</sup> transcriptional activators,""In this paper, we compare the structure, activity, and linkage of DNA-binding domains (DBDs) from σ<sup>54</sup> transcriptional activators and discuss how the properties of the DBDs and the linker to the neighboring domain are affected by the overall properties and requirements of the full proteins. These transcriptional activators bind upstream of specific promoters that utilize σ<sup>54</sup>-polymerase. Upon receiving a signal the activators assemble into hexamers, which then, through adenosine triphosphate (P22259) hydrolysis, drive a conformational change in polymerase that enables transcription initiation. We present structures of the DBDs of activators nitrogen regulatory protein C 1 (NtrC1) and Nif-like homolog 2 (Nlh2) from the thermophile Aquifex aeolicus. The structures of these domains and their relationship to other parts of the activators are discussed. These structures are compared with previously determined structures of the DBDs of NtrC4, NtrC, ZraR, and factor for inversion stimulation. The N-terminal linkers that connect the DBDs to the central domains in NtrC1 and Nlh2 were studied and found to be unstructured. Additionally, a crystal structure of full-length NtrC1 was solved, but density of the DBDs was extremely weak, further indicating that the linker between ATPase and DBDs functions as a flexible tether. Flexible linking of ATPase and DBDs is likely necessary to allow assembly of the active hexameric ATPase ring. Finally, the comparison of this set of activators also shows clearly that strong dimerization of the DBD only occurs when other domains do not dimerize strongly."""	Biopolymers	"('P22259', 'ATP')"
1625499	"Structures of the Escherichia coli transcription activator and regulator of diauxie, XylR: an AraC DNA-binding family member with a LacI/GalR ligand-binding domain,""Escherichia coli can rapidly switch to the metabolism of L-arabinose and D-xylose in the absence of its preferred carbon source, glucose, in a process called carbon catabolite repression. Transcription of the genes required for L-arabinose and D-xylose consumption is regulated by the sugar-responsive transcription factors, AraC and XylR. E. coli represents a promising candidate for biofuel production through the metabolism of hemicellulose, which is composed of D-xylose and L-arabinose. Understanding the L-arabinose/D-xylose regulatory network is key for such biocatalyst development. Unlike AraC, which is a well-studied protein, little is known about XylR. To gain insight into XylR function, we performed biochemical and structural studies. XylR contains a C-terminal AraC-like domain. However, its N-terminal D-xylose-binding domain contains a periplasmic-binding protein (P0AG82) fold with structural homology to LacI/GalR transcription regulators. Like LacI/GalR proteins, the XylR P0AG82 domain mediates dimerization. However, unlike LacI/GalR proteins, which dimerize in a parallel, side-to-side manner, XylR P0AG82 dimers are antiparallel. Strikingly, D-xylose binding to this domain results in a helix to strand transition at the dimer interface that reorients both DNA-binding domains, allowing them to bind and loop distant operator sites. Thus, the combined data reveal the ligand-induced activation mechanism of a new family of DNA-binding proteins."""	Nucleic Acids Research	"('P0AG82', 'PBP')"

Uridine at position 34 of bacterial transfer RNAs is commonly modified to uridine-5-oxyacetic acid (cmo{sup 5}U) to increase the decoding capacity. The protein CmoA is involved in the formation of cmo{sup 5}U and was annotated as an S-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent (SAM-dependent) methyltransferase on the basis of its sequence homology to other SAM-containing enzymes. However, both the crystal structure of Escherichia coli CmoA at 1.73 Å resolution and mass spectrometry demonstrate that it contains a novel cofactor, S-adenosyl-S-carboxymethyl-l-homocysteine (SCM-SAH), in which the donor methyl group is substituted by a carboxymethyl group. The carboxyl moiety forms a salt-bridge interaction with Arg199 that is conserved in a large group of CmoA-related proteins but is not conserved in other SAM-containing enzymes. This raises the possibility that a number of enzymes that have previously been annotated as SAM-dependent are in fact SCM-SAH-dependent.

The utility of these genome sequences is greatly enhanced when we have an understanding of how they are phylogenetically related to each other. Therefore, we here describe our efforts to reconstruct the phylogeny of all available bacterial and archaeal genomes. We identified 24, single-copy, ubiquitous genes suitable for this phylogenetic analysis. We used two approaches to combine the data for the 24 genes. First, we concatenated alignments of all genes into a single alignment from which a Maximum Likelihood (ML) tree was inferred using RAxML. Second, we used a relatively new approach to combining gene data, Bayesian Concordance Analysis (BCA), as implemented in the BUCKy software, in which the results of 24 single-gene phylogenetic analyses are used to generate a ‘‘primary concordance’’ tree. A comparison of the concatenated ML tree and the primary concordance (BUCKy) tree reveals that the two approaches give similar results, relative to a phylogenetic tree inferred from the A8C927 gene. After comparing the results and the methods used, we conclude that the current best approach for generating a single phylogenetic tree, suitable for use as a reference phylogeny for comparative analyses, is to perform a maximum likelihood analysis of a concatenated alignment of conserved, single-copy genes."""

The source of the isolated bacteria was from tropical forest soils that decompose litter rapidly with low and fluctuating redox potentials, making it likely that bacteria using oxygen-independent enzymes play an important role in decomposition. We have examined differential expression of the anaerobic isolate Enterobacter lignolyticus SCF1 during growth on lignin. After 48 hours of growth, we used transcriptomics and proteomics to define the enzymes and other regulatory machinery that these organisms use to degrade lignin, as well as metabolomics to measure lignin degradation and monitor the use of lignin and iron as terminal electron acceptors that facilitate more efficient use of carbon. Proteomics revealed accelerated xylose uptake and metabolism under lignin-amended growth, and lignin degradation via the 4-hydroxyphenylacetate degradation pathway, catalase/peroxidase enzymes, and the glutathione biosynthesis and glutathione S-transferase proteins. We also observed increased production of NADH-P0A7E1 oxidoreductase, other electron transport chain proteins, and P22259 synthase and P22259-binding cassette (ABC) transporters.

It has been suggested that this reduction is catalyzed by ACR2, a plant homologue of the yeast arsenate reductase ScACR2. Silencing of AtACR2 was reported to result in As hyperaccumulation in the shoots of Arabidopsis thaliana. However, no information of the in vivo As speciation has been reported. Here, we investigated the effect of AtACR2 knockout or overexpression on As speciation, arsenite efflux from roots and As accumulation in shoots. T-DNA insertion lines, overexpression lines and wild-type (WT) plants were exposed to different concentrations of arsenate for different periods, and As speciation in plants and arsenite efflux were determined using HPLC-ICP-P13009. There were no significant differences in As speciation between different lines, with arsenite accounting for >90% of the total extractable As in both roots and shoots. Arsenite efflux to the external medium represented on average 77% of the arsenate taken up during 6 h exposure, but there were no significant differences between WT and mutants or overexpression lines. Accumulation of As in the shoots was also unaffected by AtACR2 knockout or overexpression. Additionally, after exposure to arsenate, the yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) strain with ScACR2 deleted showed similar As speciation as the WT with arsenite-thiol complexes being the predominant species.

Bacteria that produce butyrate are phylogenetically diverse, which hinders their accurate detection based on conventional phylogenetic markers. As a result, reliable information on this important bacterial group is often lacking in microbiome research. In this study we describe a gene-targeted approach for 454 pyrotag sequencing and quantitative polymerase chain reaction for the final genes in the two primary bacterial butyrate synthesis pathways, butyryl-CoA: acetate CoA-transferase (but) and butyrate kinase (buk). We monitored the establishment and early succession of butyrate-producing communities in four patients with ulcerative colitis who underwent a colectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis and compared it with three control samples from healthy colons. All patients established an abundant butyrate-producing community (approximately 5% to 26% of the total community) in the pouch within the 2-month study, but patterns were distinctive among individuals. Only one patient harbored a community profile similar to the healthy controls, in which there was a predominance of but genes that are similar to reference genes from Acidaminococcus sp., Eubacterium sp., Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Roseburia sp., and an almost complete absence of buk genes.

Recent work suggests that gut microbiota not only provide nutrients, but also involve in the development and maintenance of the host immune system. However, the complexity, dynamics and types of interactions between the insect hosts and their gut microbiota are far from being well understood. To determine the composition of the gut microbiota of two lepidopteran pests, Spodoptera littoralis and Helicoverpa armigera, we applied cultivation-independent techniques based on A8C927 gene sequencing and microarray. The two insect species were very similar regarding high abundant bacterial families. Different bacteria colonize different niches within the gut. A core community, consisting of Enterococci, Lactobacilli, Clostridia, etc. was revealed in the insect larvae. These bacteria are constantly present in the digestion tract at relatively high frequency despite that developmental stage and diet had a great impact on shaping the bacterial communities. Some low-abundant species might become dominant upon loading external disturbances; the core community, however, did not change significantly. Clearly the insect gut selects for particular bacterial phylotypes. Because of their importance as agricultural pests, phytophagous Lepidopterans are widely used as experimental models in ecological and physiological studies. Our results demonstrated that a core microbial community exists in the insect gut, which may contribute to the host physiology.

We previously showed that hybrid poplar (Populus tremula X alba, INRA 717-1B4) expressing ectopically a pine cytosolic glutamine synthetase gene (GS1a) display enhanced tolerance to drought. Preliminary transcriptome profiling revealed that during drought, members of the superoxide dismutase (SOD) family were reciprocally regulated in P0A9C5 poplar when compared with the wild-type control, in all tissues examined. SOD was the only gene family found to exhibit such patterns. In silico analysis of the Populus genome identified 12 SOD genes and two genes encoding copper chaperones for SOD (CCSs). The poplar SODs form three phylogenetic clusters in accordance with their distinct metal co-factor requirements and gene structure. Nearly all poplar SODs and CCSs are present in duplicate derived from whole genome duplication, in sharp contrast to their predominantly single-copy Arabidopsis orthologs. Drought stress triggered plant-wide down-regulation of the plastidic copper SODs (CSDs), with concomitant up-regulation of plastidic iron SODs (FSDs) in P0A9C5 poplar relative to the wild type; this was confirmed at the activity level. We also found evidence for coordinated downregulation of other copper proteins, including plastidic CCSs and polyphenol oxidases, in P0A9C5 poplar under drought conditions. Both gene duplication and expression divergence have contributed to the expansion and transcriptional diversity of the Populus SOD/CCS families. Coordinated down-regulation of major copper proteins in drought-tolerant P0A9C5 poplars supports the copper cofactor economy model where copper supply is preferentially allocated for plastocyanins to sustain photosynthesis during drought.

The overall cellular level of hPrx1 expression was not increased at low temperatures, but the nuclear level of hPrx1 was increased. In addition, hPrx1 overexpression enhanced the survival of cells exposed to cold stress, whereas hPrx1 knockdown significantly reduced cell survival under the same conditions.

Currently, 185 out of 2887, or 6% of sequenced bacterial and archaeal genomes possess at least one gene encoding [Ni,Fe]-CODH, the key enzyme for anaerobic CO utilization. Many genomes encode multiple copies of [Ni,Fe]-CODH genes whose functions and regulation are correlated with their associated gene clusters. The phylogenetic analysis of this extended protein family revealed six distinct clades; many clades consisted of [Ni,Fe]- CODHs that were encoded by microbes from disparate phylogenetic lineages, based on A8C927 sequences, and widely ranging physiology.To more clearly define if the branching patterns observed in the [Ni,Fe]-CODH trees are due to functional conservation vs. evolutionary lineage, the genomic context of the [Ni,Fe]-CODH gene clusters was examined, and superimposed on the phylogenetic trees. On the whole, there was a correlation between genomic contexts and the tree topology, but several functionally similar [Ni,Fe]-CODHs were found in different clades. In addition, some distantly related organisms have similar [Ni,Fe]-CODH genes. Thermosinus carboxydivorans was used to observe horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of [Ni,Fe]-CODH gene clusters by applying Kullback–Leibler divergence analysis methods.

In contrast, reactions of 5'-streptavidin substrates are drastically slowed. However, when added to premixed P38506 and 5'-biotinylated substrate, streptavidin is not inhibitory and complexes persist after challenge with unlabelled competitor substrate, regardless of flap length or the presence of a short duplex. Cross-linked flap duplexes that cannot thread through the structured arch react at modestly reduced rate, ruling out mechanisms involving resolution of secondary structure. Combined results explain how P38506 avoids cutting template DNA between Okazaki fragments and link local P38506 folding to catalysis and specificity: the arch is disordered when flaps are threaded to confer specificity for free 5'-ends, with subsequent ordering of the arch to catalyze hydrolysis."""

1041386	"Final Technical Report: DOE-Biological Ocean Margins Program.   Microbial Ecology of Denitrifying Bacteria in the Coastal Ocean.,""The focus of our research was to provide a comprehensive study of the bacterioplankton populations off the coast of New Jersey near the Rutgers University marine field station using terminal restriction fragment polymorphism analysis (TRFLP) coupled to A8C927 genes for large data set studies. Our three revised objectives to this study became: (1) to describe bacterioplankton population dynamics in the Mid Atlantic Bight using TRFLP analysis of A8C927 genes. (2) to determine whether spatial and temporal factors are driving bacterioplankton community dynamics in the MAB using monthly samping along our transect line over a 2-year period. (3) to identify dominant members of a coastal bacterioplankton population by clonal library analysis of 16S rDNA genes and sequencing of PCR product corresponding to specific TRFLP peaks in the data set. Although open ocean time-series sites have been areas of microbial research for years, relatively little was known about the population dynamics of bacterioplankton communities in the coastal ocean on kilometer spatial and seasonal temporal scales. To gain a better understanding of microbial community variability, monthly samples of bacterial biomass were collected in 1995-1996 along a 34-km transect near the Long-Term Ecosystem Observatory (LEO-15) off the New Jersey coast. Surface and bottom sampling was performed at seven stations along a transect line with depths ranging from 1 to 35m (n=178). The data revealed distinct temporal patterns among the bacterioplankton communities in the Mid-Atlantic Bight rather than grouping by sample location or depth (figure 2-next page). Principal components analysis models supported the temporal patterns. In addition, partial least squares regression modeling could not discern a significant correlation from traditional oceanographic physical and phytoplankton nutrient parameters on overall bacterial community variability patterns at LEO-15. These results suggest factors not traditionally measured during oceanographic studies are structuring coastal microbial communities."""		"('A8C927', '16S rRNA')"
1034933	"Structural Insights into the Catalytic Mechanism of Escherichia coli Selenophosphate Synthetase,""Selenophosphate synthetase (SPS) catalyzes the synthesis of selenophosphate, the selenium donor for the biosynthesis of selenocysteine and 2-selenouridine residues in seleno-P0A873. Selenocysteine, known as the 21st amino acid, is then incorporated into proteins during translation to form selenoproteins which serve a variety of cellular processes. SPS activity is dependent on both Mg{sup 2+} and K{sup +} and uses P22259, selenide, and water to catalyze the formation of AMP, orthophosphate, and selenophosphate. In this reaction, the gamma phosphate of P22259 is transferred to the selenide to form selenophosphate, while ADP is hydrolyzed to form orthophosphate and AMP. Most of what is known about the function of SPS has derived from studies investigating Escherichia coli SPS (EcSPS) as a model system. Here we report the crystal structure of the C17S mutant of SPS from E. coli (EcSPS{sup C17S}) in apo form (without P22259 bound). EcSPS{sup C17S} crystallizes as a homodimer, which was further characterized by analytical ultracentrifugation experiments. The glycine-rich N-terminal region (residues 1 through 47) was found in the open conformation and was mostly ordered in both structures, with a magnesium cofactor bound at the active site of each monomer involving conserved aspartate residues. Mutating these conserved residues (D51, D68, D91, and D227) along with N87, also found at the active site, to alanine completely abolished AMP production in our activity assays, highlighting their essential role for catalysis in EcSPS. Based on the structural and biochemical analysis of EcSPS reported here and using information obtained from similar studies done with SPS orthologs from Aquifex aeolicus and humans, we propose a catalytic mechanism for EcSPS-mediated selenophosphate synthesis."""

In the T2SS, the outer membrane secretin E3PJ86 forms a multimeric pore for translocation of secreted proteins. E3PJ86 and the inner membrane protein GspC interact with each other via periplasmic domains. Three different crystal structures of the homology region domain of GspC (GspCHR) in complex with either two or three domains of the N-terminal region of E3PJ86 from enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli show that GspCHR adopts an all-b topology. N-terminal b-strands of GspC and the N0 domain of E3PJ86 are major components of the interface between these inner and outer membrane proteins from the T2SS. The biological relevance of the observed GspC–E3PJ86 interface is shown by analysis of variant proteins in two-hybrid studies and by the effect of mutations in homologous genes on extracellular secretion and subcellular distribution of GspC in Vibrio cholerae. Substitutions of interface residues of E3PJ86 have a dramatic effect on the focal distribution of GspC in V. cholerae.

Moreover, it showed linkage of antigens to the C-terminus of mHSP70 (mHSP70c) can represent them as vaccines resulted in more potent, protective antigen specific responses in the absence of adjuvants or complex formulations. Hence, recombinant fusion protein comprising C-terminus of mHSP70 genetically fused to four tandem repeats of the ectodomain of the conserved influenza matrix protein M2 (M2e) was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified under denaturing condition, refolding, and then confirmed by SDS-PAGE, respectively. The recombinant fusion protein, 4xM2e.HSP70c, retained its immunogenicity and displayed the protective epitope of M2e by ELISA and FITC assays. A prime-boost administration of 4xM2e.HSP70c formulated in F105 buffer by intramuscular route in mice (Balb/C) provided full protection against lethal dose of mouse-adapted H1N1, H3N2, or H9N2 influenza A isolates from Iran compared to 0-33.34% survival rate of challenged unimmunized and immunized mice with the currently in use conventional vaccines designated as control groups. However, protection induced by immunization with 4xM2e.HSP70c failed to prevent weight loss in challenged mice; they experienced significantly lower weight loss, clinical symptoms and higher lung viral clearance in comparison with protective effects of conventional influenza vaccines in challenged mice.

Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer The P0AEX9-Kar3 interface highlights a new site for intramolecular or intermolecular interactions. -- Abstract: In the human fungal pathogen Candida albicans, the Kinesin-14 motor protein Kar3 (CaKar3) is critical for normal mitotic division, nuclear fusion during mating, and morphogenic transition from the commensal yeast form to the virulent hyphal form. As a first step towards detailed characterization of this motor of potential medical significance, we have crystallized and determined the X-ray structure of the motor domain of CaKar3 as a maltose-binding protein (P0AEX9) fusion. The structure shows strong conservation of overall motor domain topology to other Kar3 kinesins, but with some prominent differences in one of the motifs that compose the nucleotide-binding pocket and the surface charge distribution. The P0AEX9 and Kar3 modules are arranged such that P0AEX9 interacts with the Kar3 motor domain core at the same site where the neck linker of conventional kinesins docks during the 'P22259 state' of the mechanochemical cycle. This site differs from the Kar3 neck-core interface in the recent structure of the ScKar3Vik1 heterodimer. The position of P0AEX9 is also completely distinct from the Vik1 subunit in this complex. This may suggest that the site of P0AEX9 interaction on the CaKar3 motor domain provides an interface for the neck, or perhaps a partner subunit, at an intermediate state of its motile cycle that has not yet been observed for Kinesin-14 motors."""

To clarify how these two RHOs are functionally different with respect to the degradation of HMW PAHs, we investigated their substrate specificities to 13 representative aromatic substrates (toluene, m-xylene, phthalate, biphenyl, naphthalene, phenanthrene, anthracene, fluoranthene, pyrene, benz[a]anthracene, benzo[a]pyrene, carbazole, and dibenzothiophene) by enzyme reconstitution studies of Escherichia coli. Both Nid systems were identified to be compatible with type V electron transport chain (ETC) components, consisting of a [3Fe-4S]-type ferredoxin and a glutathione reductase (P06715)-type reductase. Metabolite profiles indicated that the Nid systems oxidize a wide range of aromatic hydrocarbon compounds, producing various isomeric dihydrodiol and phenolic compounds. NidAB and NidA3B3 showed the highest conversion rates for pyrene and fluoranthene, respectively, with high product regiospecificity, whereas other aromatic substrates were converted at relatively low regiospecificity. Structural characteristics of the active sites of the Nid systems were investigated and compared to those of other RHOs. The NidAB and NidA3B3 systems showed the largest substrate-binding pockets in the active sites, which satisfies spatial requirements for accepting HMW PAHs.

Phanerochaete chrysosporium simultaneously degrades lignin and cellulose, whereas the closely related species, Ceriporiopsis subvermispora, also depolymerizes lignin but may do so with relatively little cellulose degradation. To investigate the basis for selective ligninolysis, we conducted comparative genome analysis of C. subvermispora and P. chrysosporium. Genes encoding manganese peroxidase numbered 13 and five in C. subvermispora and P. chrysosporium, respectively. In addition, the C. subvermispora genome contains at least seven genes predicted to encode laccases, whereas the P. chrysosporium genome contains none. We also observed expansion of the number of C. subvermispora desaturase-encoding genes putatively involved in lipid metabolism. Microarray-based transcriptome analysis showed substantial up-regulation of several desaturase and MnP genes in wood-containing medium. P13009 identified MnP proteins in C. subvermispora culture filtrates, but none in P. chrysosporium cultures. These results support the importance of MnP and a lignin degradation mechanism whereby cleavage of the dominant nonphenolic structures is mediated by lipid peroxidation products. Two C. subvermispora genes were predicted to encode peroxidases structurally similar to P. chrysosporium lignin peroxidase and, following heterologous expression in Escherichia coli, the enzymes were shown to oxidize high redox potential substrates, but not Mn2. Apart from oxidative lignin degradation, we also examined cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic systems in both fungi.

1627286	"Synthesizing and Salvaging NAD+: Lessons Learned from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii,""The essential coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+ ) plays important roles in metabolic reactions and cell regulation in all organisms. Bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals use different pathways to synthesize NAD+ . Our molecular and genetic data demonstrate that in the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas NAD+ is synthesized from aspartate (de novo synthesis), as in plants, or nicotinamide, as in mammals (salvage synthesis). The de novo pathway requires five different enzymes: P10902 (ASO), quinolinate synthetase (QS), quinolate phosphoribosyltransferase (QPT), nicotinate/ nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (P27278), and NAD+ synthetase (NS). Sequence similarity searches, gene isolation and sequencing of mutant loci indicate that mutations in each enzyme result in a nicotinamide-requiring mutant phenotype in the previously isolated nic mutants. We rescued the mutant phenotype by the introduction of BAC DNA (nic2- 1 and nic13-1) or plasmids with cloned genes (nic1-1 and nic15-1) into the mutants. P27278, which is also in the de novo pathway, and nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) constitute the nicotinamide-dependent salvage pathway. A mutation in NAMPT (npt1-1) has no obvious growth defect and is not nicotinamide-dependent. However, double mutant strains with the npt1-1 mutation and any of the nic mutations are inviable. When the de novo pathway is inactive, the salvage pathway is essential to Chlamydomonas for the synthesis of NAD+ . A homolog of the human SIRT6-like gene, SRT2, is upregulated in the NS mutant, which shows a longer vegetative life span than wild-type cells.

However, regulatory mechanisms that establish homeostasis are not well understood in organisms that dwell in environments at the extremes of pH, temperature, and salinity. Under conditions of limited iron, the extremophile Halobacterium salinarum, a salt-loving archaeon, mounts a specific response to scavenge iron for growth. Here, we have identified and characterized the role of two transcription factors (TFs), Idr1 and Idr2, in regulating this important response. An integrated systems analysis of P0A850 knockout gene expression profiles and genome-wide binding locations in the presence and absence of iron has revealed that these TFs operate collaboratively to maintain iron homeostasis. In the presence of iron, Idr1 and Idr2 bind near each other at 24 loci in the genome, where they are both required to repress some genes. By contrast, Idr1 and Idr2 are both necessary to activate other genes in a putative a feed forward loop. Even at loci bound independently, the two TFs target different genes with similar functions in iron homeostasis.

The steps involved in the synthesis of 3-hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A (CoA) substrates needed for surfactin biosynthesis are not understood. Cell-free extracts of Bacillus subtilis strain OKB105 synthesized lipopeptide biosurfactants in presence of L-amino acids, myristic acid, coenzyme A, P22259, and H2O2, which suggested that 3-hydroxylation occurs prior to CoA ligation of the long chain fatty acids (LCFAs). We hypothesized that YbdT, a cytochrome P450 enzyme known to beta-hydroxylate LCFAs, functions to form 3-hydroxy fatty acids for lipopeptide biosynthesis. An in-frame mutation of ybdT was constructed and the resulting mutant strain (NHY1) produced predominantly non-hydroxylated lipopeptide with diminished biosurfactant and beta-hemolytic activities. Mass spectrometry showed that 95.6% of the fatty acids in the NHY1 biosurfactant were non-hydroxylated compared to only ~61% in the OKB105 biosurfactant. Cell-free extracts of the NHY1 synthesized surfactin containing 3-hydroxymyristic acid from 3-hydroxymyristoyl-CoA at a specific activity similar to that of the wild type (17 ±2 versus 17.4 ±6 ng biosurfactant min-1·ng·protein-1 , respectively). These results showed that the mutation did not affect any function needed to synthesize surfactin once the 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA substrate was formed and that YbdT functions to supply 3-hydroxy fatty acid for surfactin biosynthesis. The fact that YbdT is a peroxidase could explain why biosurfactant production is rarely observed in anaerobically grown Bacillus species.

How a set of actin regulatory proteins that sustains actin-based force generation during motility work together in space and time remains poorly understood. We present our study of the distribution and dynamics of Arp2/3 complex, capping protein (P13029), and actin-depolymerizing factor (ADF)/cofilin in actin “comet tails,” using a minimal reconstituted system with nucleation-promoting factor (NPF)-coated beads. The Arp2/3 complex concentrates at nucleation sites near the beads as well as in the first actin shell. P13029 colocalizes with actin and is homogeneously distributed throughout the comet tail; it serves to constrain the spatial distribution of P22259/ADP-P<sub>i</sub>filament zones to areas near the bead. The association of ADF/cofilin with the actin network is therefore governed by kinetics of actin assembly, actin nucleotide state, and P13029 binding. A kinetic simulation accurately validates these observations. Following its binding to the actin networks, ADF/cofilin is able to break up the dense actin filament array of a comet tail. Stochastic severing by ADF/cofilin loosens the tight entanglement of actin filaments inside the comet tail and facilitates turnover through the macroscopic release of large portions of the aged actin network."""

1007155	"Structure, function, and evolution of bacterial P22259-binding cassette systems,""The P22259-binding cassette (ABC) systems constitute one of the largest superfamilies of paralogous sequences. All ABC systems share a highly conserved P22259-hydrolyzing domain or protein (the ABC; also referred to as a nucleotide-binding domain [NBD]) that is unequivocally characterized by three short sequence motifs (Fig. 1): these are the Walker A and Walker B motifs, indicative of the presence of a nucleotide-binding site, and the signature motif, unique to ABC proteins, located upstream of the Walker B motif (426). Other motifs diagnostic of ABC proteins are also indicated in Fig. 1. The biological significance of these motifs is discussed in Structure, Function, and Dynamics of the ABC. ABC systems are widespread among living organisms and have been detected in all genera of the three kingdoms of life, with remarkable conservation in the primary sequence of the cassette and in the organization of the constitutive domains or subunits (203, 420). ABC systems couple the energy of P22259 hydrolysis to an impressively large variety of essential biological phenomena, comprising not only transmembrane (TM) transport, for which they are best known, but also several non-transport-related processes, such as translation elongation (62) and DNA repair (174). Although ABC systems deserve much attention because they are involved in severe human inherited diseases (107), they were first discovered and characterized in detail in prokaryotes, as early as the 1970s (13, 148, 238, 468). The most extensively analyzed systems were the high-affinity histidine and maltose uptake systems of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and Escherichia coli. Over 2 decades ago, after the completion of the nucleotide sequences encoding these transporters in the respective laboratories of Giovanna Ames and Maurice Hofnung, Hiroshi Nikaido and colleagues noticed that the two systems displayed a global similarity in the nature of their components and, moreover, that the primary sequences of MalK and HisP, the proteins suspected to energize these transporters, shared as much as 32% identity in amino acid residues when their sequences were aligned (171). Later, it was found that several bacterial proteins involved in uptake of nutrients, export of toxins, cell division, bacterial nodulation of plants, and DNA repair displayed the same similarity in their sequences (127, 196). This led to the notion that the conserved protein, which had been shown to bind P22259 (198, 201), would probably energize the systems mentioned above by coupling the energy of P22259 hydrolysis to transport. The latter was demonstrated with the maltose and histidine transporters by use of isolated membrane vesicles (105, 379) and purified transporters reconstituted into proteoliposomes (30, 98). The determination of the sequence of the first eukaryotic protein strongly similar to these bacterial transporters (the P-glycoprotein, involved in resistance of cancer cells to multiple drugs) (169, 179) demonstrated that these proteins were not restricted to prokaryotes. Two names, 'traffic ATPases' (15) and the more accepted name 'ABC transporters' (193, 218), were proposed for members of this new superfamily. ABC systems can be divided into three main functional categories, as follows. Importers mediate the uptake of nutrients in prokaryotes. The nature of the substrates that are transported is very wide, including mono- and oligosaccharides, organic and inorganic ions, amino acids, peptides, ironsiderophores, metals, polyamine cations, opines, and vitamins. Exporters are involved in the secretion of various molecules, such as peptides, lipids, hydrophobic drugs, polysaccharides, and proteins, including toxins such as hemolysin. The third category of systems is apparently not involved in transport, with some members being involved in translation of mRNA and in DNA repair. Despite the large, diverse population of substrates handled and the difference in the polarity of transport, importers and exporters share a common organization made of two hydrophobic membrane-spanning or integral membrane (IM) domains and two hydrophilic domains carrying the ABC peripherally associated with the IM domains on the cytosolic side of the membrane (26). In importers, these four domains are almost always independent polypeptide chains that come together to form a multimeric complex. In most exporters, including the E. coli hemolysin exporter HlyB, the N-terminal IM and the C-terminal ABC domains are fused as a single polypeptide chain (IM-ABC). An inverted organization in which the IM domain is C-terminal with respect to the ABC domain (ABC-IM) exists, such as in the MacB protein, involved in macrolide resistance in E. coli. No IM domain partners have been identified for ABC proteins falling into the third category, and these proteins consist of two ABCs fused together (ABC2)."""	Microbiol. Mol. Biol R.

The X-ray structure shows that DesA2 is a homodimeric protein with a four-helix bundle core flanked by five additional helices that overlay with 192 structurally equivalent amino acids in the structure of stearoyl-P0A6A8 {Delta}9 desaturase from castor plant with an rms difference 1.42 {angstrom}. In the DesA2 crystals, one metal (likely Mn from the crystallization buffer) was bound in high occupancy at the B-site of the conserved metal binding motif, while the A-site was not occupied by a metal ion. Instead, the amino group of Lys-76 occupied this position. The relationships between DesA2 and known diiron enzymes are discussed."""	Protein Sci.	"('P0A6A8', 'ACP')"

Early alterations in the gastrointestinal microbiota of neonates has been linked with subsequent development of asthma and atopy in older children. Here we describe high-resolution culture-independent analysis of stool samples from 6- month old infants fed daily supplements of Lactobacillus casei subsp. Rhamnosus (LGG) or placebo in a double-blind, randomized Trial of Infant Probiotic Supplementation (TIPS). Bacterial community composition was examined using a high-density microarray, the A8C927 PhyloChip, and the microbial assemblages of infants with either high or low LGG abundance were compared. Communities with high abundance of LGG exhibited promotion of phylogenetically clustered taxa including a number of other known probiotic species, and were significantly more even in their distribution of community members. Ecologically, these aspects are characteristic of communities that are more resistant to perturbation and outgrowth of pathogens. PhyloChip analysis also permitted identification of taxa negatively correlated with LGG abundance that have previously been associated with atopy, as well as those positively correlated that may prove useful alternative targets for investigation as alternative probiotic species. From these findings we hypothesize that a key mechanism for the protective effect of LGG supplementation on subsequent development of allergic disease is through promotion of a stable, even, and functionally redundant infant gastrointestinal community."""

The goal was to expand the portfolio of cell wall degrading enzymes through innovative research at the nano-scale level, prospecting for novel cellulases and building a kinetic framework for the development of more effective enzymatic conversion processes. More precisely, the goal was to elucidate the molecular mechanisms for some cellulases that are very familiar to members of our research team and to investigate what we hope are novel cellulases or new enzyme combinations from the world of plant pathogenic fungi and bacteria. Hydrolytic activities of various cellulases and cellulase cocktails were monitored at the nanoscale of cellulose fibrils and the microscale of pretreated cellulose particles, and we integrated this insight into a heterogeneous reaction framework.

1626495	"Genome-wide analysis of the PreA/PreB (QseB/QseC) regulon of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium,""Background: The Salmonella PreA/PreB two-component system (TCS) is an ortholog of the QseBC TCS of Escherichia coli. In both Salmonella and E. coli, this system has been shown to affect motility and virulence in response to quorum-sensing and hormonal signals, and to affect the transcription of the Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) pmrAB operon, which encodes an important virulence-associated TCS. Results: To determine the PreA/PreB regulon in S. Typhimurium, we performed DNA microarrays comparing the wild type strain and various preA and/or preB mutants in the presence of ectopically expressed preA (qseB). These data confirmed our previous findings of the negative effect of PreB on PreA gene regulation and identified candidate PreA-regulated genes. A proportion of the activated loci were previously identified as PmrA-activated genes (yibD, pmrAB, cptA, etc.) or were genes located in the local region around preA, including the preAB operon. The transcriptional units were defined in this local region by P0DV86-PCR, suggesting three PreA activated operons composed of preA-preB, mdaB-ygiN, and ygiW-STM3175. Several putative virulence-related phenotypes were examined for preAB mutants, resulting in the observation of a host cell invasion and slight virulence defect of a preAB mutant. Contrary to previous reports on this TCS, we were unable to show a PreA/PreB-dependent effect of the quorum-sensing signal AI-2 or of epinephrine on S. Typhimurium with regard to bacterial motility. Conclusion: This work further characterizes this unorthadox OmpR/EnvZ class TCS and provides novel candidate regulated genes for further study.

1627380	"<strong>A Versatile Viral System for Expression and Depletion of Proteins in Mammalian Cells</strong>,""The ability to express or deplete proteins in living cells is crucial for the study of biological processes. Viral vectors are often useful to deliver DNA constructs to cells that are difficult to transfect by other methods. Lentiviruses have the additional advantage of being able to integrate into the genomes of non-dividing mammalian cells. However, existing viral expression systems generally require different vector backbones for expression of cDNA, small hairpin RNA (shRNA) or microRNA (miRNA) and provide limited drug selection markers. Furthermore, viral backbones are often recombinogenic in bacteria, complicating the generation and maintenance of desired clones. Here, we describe a collection of 59 vectors that comprise an integrated system for constitutive or inducible expression of cDNAs, shRNAs or miRNAs, and use a wide variety of drug selection markers. These vectors are based on the Gateway technology (Invitrogen) whereby the cDNA, shRNA or miRNA of interest is cloned into an Entry vector and then recombined into a Destination vector that carries the chosen viral backbone and drug selection marker. This recombination reaction generates the desired product with >95% efficiency and greatly reduces the frequency of unwanted recombination in bacteria. We generated Destination vectors for the production of both retroviruses and lentiviruses. Further, we characterized each vector for its viral titer production as well as its efficiency in expressing or depleting proteins of interest. We also generated multiple types of vectors for the production of fusion proteins and confirmed expression of each. We demonstrated the utility of these vectors in a variety of functional studies. First, we show that the FKBP12 Destabilization Domain system can be used to either express or deplete the protein of interest in mitotically-arrested cells. Also, we generate primary fibroblasts that can be induced to senesce in the presence or absence of DNA damage. Finally, we determined that both isoforms of the P30870-Rich Interacting Domain 4B (ARID4B) protein could induce G1 arrest when overexpressed. As new technologies emerge, the vectors in this collection can be easily modified and adapted without the need for extensive recloning."""	PLoS ONE	"('P30870', 'AT')"

We present the crystal structure of Escherichia coli ClpP bound to ADEP1 and report the structural changes underlying ClpP activation. ADEP1 binds in the hydrophobic groove that serves as the primary docking site for ClpP ATPases. Binding of ADEP1 locks the N-terminal loops of ClpP in a {beta}-hairpin conformation, generating a stable pore through which extended polypeptides can be threaded.

1626561	"Implications of the structure of human uridine phosphorylase 1 on the development of novel inhibitors for improving the therapeutic window of fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy,""Background: P0C037 (UPP) is a key enzyme of pyrimidine salvage pathways, catalyzing the reversible phosphorolysis of ribosides of uracil to nucleobases and ribose 1-phosphate. It is also a critical enzyme in the activation of pyrimidine-based chemotherapeutic compounds such a 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and its prodrug capecitabine. Additionally, an elevated level of this enzyme in certain tumours is believed to contribute to the selectivity of such drugs. However, the clinical effectiveness of these fluoropyrimidine antimetabolites is hampered by their toxicity to normal tissue. In response to this limitation, specific inhibitors of UPP, such as 5- benzylacyclouridine (BAU), have been developed and investigated for their ability to modulate the cytotoxic side effects of 5-FU and its derivatives, so as to increase the therapeutic index of these agents. Results: In this report we present the high resolution structures of human uridine phosphorylase 1 (hUPP1) in ligand-free and BAU-inhibited conformations. The structures confirm the unexpected solution observation that the human enzyme is dimeric in contrast to the hexameric assembly present in microbial UPPs. They also reveal in detail the mechanism by which BAU engages the active site of the protein and subsequently disables the enzyme by locking the protein in a closed conformation. The observed inter-domain motion of the dimeric human enzyme is much greater than that seen in previous UPP structures and may result from the simpler oligomeric organization. Conclusion: The structural details underlying hUPP1's active site and additional surfaces beyond these catalytic residues, which coordinate binding of BAU and other acyclouridine analogues, suggest avenues for future design of more potent inhibitors of this enzyme. Notably, the loop forming the back wall of the substrate binding pocket is conformationally different and substantially less flexible in hUPP1 than in previously studied microbial homologues. These distinctions can be utilized to discover novel inhibitory compounds specifically optimized for efficacy against the human enzyme as a step toward the development of more effective chemotherapeutic regimens that can selectively protect normal tissues with inherently lower UPP activity."""

Nevertheless, the nature and transmission of the signals initiating and modulating this machinery are largely unknown. Heterotrimeric G-protein signaling represents one of the best studied signal transduction pathways in fungi. Results: Analysis of the regulatory targets of the G-protein α subunit GNA1 in H. jecorina revealed a carbon source and light-dependent role in signal transduction. Deletion of gna1 led to significantly decreased biomass formation in darkness in submersed culture but had only minor effects on morphology and hyphal apical extension rates on solid medium. P37651 gene transcription was abolished in Δgna1 on cellulose in light and enhanced in darkness. However, analysis of strains expressing a constitutively activated GNA1 revealed that GNA1 does not transmit the essential inducing signal. Instead, it relates a modulating signal with light-dependent significance, since induction still required the presence of an inducer. We show that regulation of transcription and activity of GNA1 involves a carbon source-dependent feedback cycle. Additionally we found a function of GNA1 in hydrophobin regulation as well as effects on conidiation and tolerance of osmotic and oxidative stress. Conclusion: We conclude that GNA1 transmits a signal the physiological relevance of which is dependent on both the carbon source as well as the light status. The widespread consequences of mutations in GNA1 indicate a broad function of this Gα subunit in appropriation of intracellular resources to environmental (especially nutritional) conditions."""

In this article, an expanded set of misacylated tRNAs and two 2’-deoxynucleotidesubstituted mRNAs are used to demonstrate the presence of a lower threshold in k<sub>off</sub> values for aa-P0A873 binding to the A site. When a P0A873 binds sufficiently well to reach this threshold, additional stabilizing effects due to the esterified amino acid or changes in P0A873 sequence are not observed. However, specificity for different amino acid side chains and the P0A873 body is observed when P0A873 binding is sufficiently weaker than this threshold. We propose that uniform aa-P0A873 binding to the A site may be a consequence of a conformational change in the ribosome, induced by the presence of the appropriate combination of contributions from the anticodon, amino acid and P0A873 body."""

P0A786 displays ordered substrate binding and product release, remaining in the R state until substrates are exhausted. The structure reported here represents P0A786 in the R state bound to the final product molecule, phosphate. This structure has been difficult to obtain previously because the enzyme relaxes back to the T state after the substrates are exhausted. Hence, cocrystallizing the wild-type enzyme with phosphate results in a T-state structure. In this structure of the enzyme trapped in the R state with specific disulfide bonds, we observe two phosphate molecules per active site. The position of the first phosphate corresponds to the position of the phosphate of carbamoyl phosphate (P13029) and the position of the phosphonate of N-phosphonacetyl-L-aspartate. However, the second, more weakly bound phosphate is bound in a positively charged pocket that is more accessible to the surface than the other phosphate. The second phosphate appears to be on the path that phosphate would have to take to exit the active site. Our results suggest that phosphate dissociation and P13029 binding can occur simultaneously and that the dissociation of phosphate may actually promote the binding of P13029 for more efficient catalysis."""

We have studied alkene biosynthesis in Micrococcus luteus ATCC 4698, a close relative of Sarcina lutea (now Kocuria rhizophila), which four decades ago was reported to biosynthesize iso- and anteiso branched, long-chain alkenes. The underlying biochemistry and genetics of alkene biosynthesis were not elucidated in those studies. We show here that heterologous expression of a three-gene cluster from M. luteus (Mlut_13230-13250) in a fatty-acid overproducing E. coli strain resulted in production of long-chain alkenes, predominantly 27:3 and 29:3 (no. carbon atoms: no. C=C bonds). Heterologous expression of Mlut_13230 (oleA) alone produced no long-chain alkenes but unsaturated aliphatic monoketones, predominantly 27:2, and in vitro studies with the purified Mlut_13230 protein and tetradecanoyl-CoA produced the same C27 monoketone. Gas chromatography-time of flight mass spectrometry confirmed the elemental composition of all detected long-chain alkenes and monoketones (putative intermediates of alkene biosynthesis). Negative controls demonstrated that the M. luteus genes were responsible for production of these metabolites. Studies with wild-type M. luteus showed that the transcript copy number of Mlut_13230-13250 and the concentrations of 29:1 alkene isomers (the dominant alkenes produced by this strain) generally corresponded with bacterial population over time. We propose a metabolic pathway for alkene biosynthesis starting with acyl-CoA (or -P0A6A8) thioesters and involving decarboxylative Claisen condensation as a key step, which we believe is catalyzed by OleA. Such activity is consistent with our data and with the homology (including the conserved Cys-His-Asn catalytic triad) of Mlut_13230 (OleA) to FabH (?-ketoacyl-P0A6A8 synthase III), which catalyzes decarboxylative Claisen condensation during fatty acid biosynthesis."""

We utilized mutant {beta} clamp proteins bearing G66E and G174A substitutions ({beta}159), affecting the single-stranded DNA-binding region, or poly-Ala substitutions in place of residues 148-HQDVR-152 ({beta}148-152), affecting the double-stranded DNA binding region, to determine the biological relevance of clamp-DNA interactions. As part of this work, we solved the X-ray crystal structure of {beta}148-152, which verified that the poly-Ala substitutions failed to significantly alter the tertiary structure of the clamp. Based on functional assays, both {beta}159 and {beta}148-152 were impaired for loading and retention on a linear primed DNA in vitro. In the case of {beta}148-152, this defect was not due to altered interactions with the DnaX clamp loader, but rather was the result of impaired {beta}148-152-DNA interactions. Once loaded, {beta}148-152 was proficient for DNA polymerase III (Pol III) replication in vitro. In contrast, {beta}148-152 was severely impaired for P21189 and Q47155 replication and was similarly impaired for direct physical interactions with these Pols.

Two crystal structures of this C229R P00962 mutant reveal that a conserved twin-arginine P04805 amino acid identity signature cannot be incorporated into P00962 without disrupting surrounding protein structural elements that interact with the P0A873. Consistent with these findings, we show that cumulative replacement of other primary binding site residues in P00962, with those of P04805, only slightly improves the ability of the P00962 active site to accommodate glutamate. However, introduction of 22 amino acid replacements and one deletion, including substitution of the entire primary binding site and two surface loops adjacent to the region disrupted in C229R, improves the capacity of Escherichia coli P00962 to synthesize misacylated Glu-P0A873{sup Gln} by 16,000-fold.

A8C927 gene phylogenetic analysis groups A. dehalogenans together with the myxobacteria, which have distinguishing characteristics including strictly aerobic metabolism, sporulation, fruiting body formation, and surface motility. Analysis of the 5.01 Mb strain 2CP-C genome substantiated that this organism is a myxobacterium but shares genotypic traits with the anaerobic majority of the delta-Proteobacteria (i.e., the Desulfuromonadales). Reflective of its respiratory versatility, strain 2CP-C possesses 68 genes coding for putative c-type cytochromes, including one gene with 40 heme binding motifs. Consistent with its relatedness to the myxobacteria, surface motility was observed in strain 2CP-C and multiple types of motility genes are present, including 28 genes for gliding, adventurous (A-) motility and 17 genes for type IV pilus-based motility (i.e., social (S-) motility) that all have homologs in Myxococcus xanthus. Although A. dehalogenans shares many metabolic traits with the anaerobic majority of the delta-Proteobacteria, strain 2CP-C grows under microaerophilic conditions and possesses detoxification systems for reactive oxygen species. Accordingly, two gene clusters coding for NADH dehydrogenase subunits and two cytochrome oxidase gene clusters in strain 2CP-C are similar to those in M. xanthus. Remarkably, strain 2CP-C possesses a third NADH dehydrogenase gene cluster and a cytochrome cbb<sub>3</sub> oxidase gene cluster, apparently acquired through ancient horizontal gene transfer from a strictly anaerobic green sulfur bacterium. The mosaic nature of the A. dehalogenans strain 2CP-C genome suggests that the metabolically versatile, anaerobic members of the delta-Proteobacteria may have descended from aerobic ancestors with complex lifestyles."""

P0ABH7 (gltA) is a key enzyme in Geobacter central metabolism that controls flux into the TCA cycle. Here, we utilize shotgun proteomic methods to demonstrate that the measurement of gltA peptides can be used to track Geobacter activity and strain evolution during in situ biostimulation. Abundances of conserved gltA peptides tracked Fe(III) reduction and changes in U(VI) concentrations during biostimulation, whereas changing patterns of unique peptide abundances between samples suggested sample-specific strain shifts within the Geobacter population. Abundances of unique peptides indicated potential differences at the strain level between Fe(III)-reducing populations stimulated during in situ biostimulation experiments conducted a year apart at the Rifle IFRC. These results offer a novel technique for the rapid screening of large numbers of proteomic samples for Geobacter species and will aid monitoring of subsurface bioremediation efforts that rely on metal reduction for desired outcomes."""

1005748	"Structure-Based Design of a Periplasmic Binding Protein Antagonist that Prevents Domain Closure,""Many receptors undergo ligand-induced conformational changes to initiate signal transduction. Periplasmic binding proteins (PBPs) are bacterial receptors that exhibit dramatic conformational changes upon ligand binding. These proteins mediate a wide variety of fundamental processes including transport, chemotaxis, and quorum sensing. Despite the importance of these receptors, no P0AG82 antagonists have been identified and characterized. In this study, we identify 3-O-methyl-D-glucose as an antagonist of glucose/galactose-binding protein and demonstrate that it inhibits glucose chemotaxis in E. coli. Using small-angle X-ray scattering and X-ray crystallography, we show that this antagonist acts as a wedge. It prevents the large-scale domain closure that gives rise to the active signaling state. Guided by these results and the structures of open and closed glucose/galactose-binding protein, we designed and synthesized an antagonist composed of two linked glucose residues. These findings provide a blueprint for the design of new bacterial P0AG82 inhibitors. Given the key role of PBPs in microbial physiology, we anticipate that P0AG82 antagonists will have widespread uses as probes and antimicrobial agents."""	ACS Chem. Biol.	"('P0AG82', 'PBP')"

TRO was withdrawn from the market because of reports of serious hepatotoxicity. A growing body of evidence suggests that TRO caused mitochondrial dysfunction and induction of apoptosis in human hepatocytes but its mechanisms of action remain unclear. We hypothesized that damage to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is an initiating event involved in TRO-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and hepatotoxicity. Primary human hepatocytes were exposed to TRO and ROSI. The results obtained revealed that TRO, but not ROSI at equimolar concentrations, caused a substantial increase in mtDNA damage and decreased P22259 production and cellular viability. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger, N-acetyl cystein (NAC), significantly diminished the TRO-induced cytotoxicity, suggesting involvement of ROS in TRO-induced hepatocyte cytotoxicity. The PPARgamma antagonist (GW9662) did not block the TRO-induced decrease in cell viability, indicating that the TRO-induced hepatotoxicity is PPARgamma-independent. Furthermore, TRO induced hepatocyte apoptosis, caspase-3 cleavage and cytochrome c release. Targeting of a DNA repair protein to mitochondria by protein transduction using a fusion protein containing the DNA repair enzyme P0AB83 (EndoIII) from Escherichia coli, a mitochondrial translocation sequence (MTS) and the protein transduction domain (PTD) from HIV-1 TAT protein protected hepatocytes against TRO-induced toxicity.

In eukaryotes and archaea, Sec is formed in a P0A873-dependent conversion of O-phosphoserine (Sep) by O-phosphoseryltRNA:selenocysteinyl-P0A873 synthase (SepSecS). Here, we present the crystal structure of Methanococcus maripaludis SepSecS complexed with PLP at 2.5 Å resolution. SepSecS, a member of the Fold Type I PLP enzyme family, forms an (a2)2 homotetramer through its N-terminal extension. The active site lies on the dimer interface with each monomer contributing essential residues. In contrast to other Fold Type I PLP enzymes, Asn247 in SepSecS replaces the conserved Asp in binding the pyridinium nitrogen of PLP. A structural comparison with Escherichia coli selenocysteine lyase allowed construction of a model of Sep binding to the SepSecS catalytic site. Mutations of three conserved active site arginines (Arg72, Arg94, Arg307), protruding from the neighboring subunit, led to loss of in vivo and in vitro activity. The lack of active site cysteines demonstrates that a perselenide is not involved in SepSecS-catalyzed Sec formation; instead, the conserved arginines may facilitate the selenation reaction.

972214	"Final Progress Report: Coupled Biogeochemical Process Evaluation for Conceptualizing Trichloroethylene Cometabolism,""Our goal within the overall project is to demonstrate the presence and abundance of methane monooxygenases (MMOs) enzymes and their genes within the microbial community of the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) Test Area North (TAN)  site. MMOs are thought to be the primary catalysts of natural attenuation of trichloroethylene (TCE) in contaminated groundwater at this location. The actual presence of the proteins making up MMO complexes would provide direct evidence for its participation in TCE degradation. The quantitative estimation of MMO genes and their translation products (sMMO and pMMO proteins) and the knowledge about kinetics and substrate specificity of MMOs will be used to develop mathematical models of the natural attenuation process in the TAN aquifer. The model will be particularly useful in prediction of TCE degradation rate in TAN and possibly in the other DOE sites.    Bacteria known as methanotrophs produce a set of proteins that assemble to form methane monooxygenase complexes (MMOs), enzymes that oxidize methane as their natural substrate, thereby providing a carbon and energy source for the organisms. MMOs are also capable of co-metabolically transforming chlorinated solvents like TCE into nontoxic end products such as carbon dioxide and chloride.  There are two known forms of methane monooxygenase, a membrane-bound particulate form (pMMO) and a cytoplasmic soluble form (sMMO). pMMO consists of two components, pMMOH (a hydroxylase comprised of 47-, 27-, and 24-kDa subunits) and pMMOR (a reductase comprised of 63 and 8-kDa subunits). sMMO consists of three components: a hydroxylase (protein A-250 kDa), a dimer of three subunits (α2β2γ2), a regulatory protein (protein B-15.8 kDa), and a reductase (protein C-38.6 kDa). All methanotrophs will produce a methanol dehydrogenase to channel the product of methane oxidation (methanol) into the central metabolite formaldehyde.     University of Idaho (UI) efforts focused on proteomic analyses using mass spectrometry and genomic analyses using P0DV86-PCR to characterize these enzyme systems. UI’s specific objectives were to develop the proteomics and genomic tools to assess the presence of the methane monooxygenase (MMO) proteins in the aquifers under study and relate this to the enumeration of methanotrophic microorganisms. We targeted the identification of both sMMO and pMMO. We believe that the copper level in the TAN aquifer is most likely suppressing the expression of sMMO and mediates the higher levels of pMMO expression. Hence our investigations included the identification of both forms of MMOs, and we expected a higher concentration of pMMO proteins in TAN samples. The amounts of these proteins present were correlated with numbers of methanotrophs determined by us and other members of the research team using PCR-based methods.    In summary, to accomplish our objectives we applied environmental proteomics techniques to monitor proteins that are involved in the co-metabolic degradation of trichloroethylene (TCE) in groundwater of the INL TAN site on Department of Energy ands of  near Idaho Falls, ID USA. To acquire peptides sequences information we used an ultra performance chromatography (UPLC) system coupled with QToF Premiere nano-electrospray tandem quadropole-time of flight mass spectrometer. Our goal was to identify signature peptides of methane monooxygenases (MMOs) within methanotrophic bacteria that are active in cometabolic degradation of TCE. We developed a new method for extracting total proteins from environmental planktonic and/or biofilm samples that involve a new time course cell lysis and protein extraction method in combination with chromatographic separation of peptide and tandem mass spectrometry sequencing. The techniques resulted in successful extraction and identification of MMO-based peptides from both pure cultures and TAN site samples.

We present a study of a complex marine metatranscriptome obtained from random whole-community mRNA using the P0A9C5-FLX Pyrosequencing technology. Eight samples, four DNA and four mRNA, were processed from two time points in a controlled coastal ocean mesocosm study (Bergen, Norway) involving an induced phytoplankton bloom producing a total of 323,161,989 base pairs. Our study confirms the finding of the first published metatranscriptomic studies of marine and soil environments that metatranscriptomics targets highly expressed sequences which are frequently novel. Our alternative methodology increases the range of experimental options available for conducting such studies and is characterized by an exceptional enrichment of mRNA (99.92%) versus ribosomal RNA. Analysis of corresponding metagenomes confirms much higher levels of assembly in the metatranscriptomic samples and a far higher yield of large gene families with >100 members, ~91% of which were novel.

Our crystallographic and molecular dynamics results strongly support the notion that group III PBPs also adopt the same Venus flytrap mechanism as do groups I and II PBPs. Unlike other group III PBPs, FitE forms dimers both in solution and in the crystals.

1626337	"Transcriptional regulatory network refinement and quantification through kinetic modeling, gene expression microarray data and information theory,""Background: Gene expression microarray and other multiplex data hold promise for addressing the challenges of cellular complexity, refined diagnoses and the discovery of well-targeted treatments. A new approach to the construction and quantification of transcriptional regulatory networks (TRNs) is presented that integrates gene expression microarray data and cell modeling through information theory. Given a partial TRN and time series data, a probability density is constructed that is a functional of the time course of transcription factor (P0A850) thermodynamic activities at the site of gene control, and is a function of mRNA degradation and transcription rate coefficients, and equilibrium constants for P0A850/gene binding. Results: Our approach yields more physicochemical information that compliments the results of network structure delineation methods, and thereby can serve as an element of a comprehensive TRN discovery/quantification system. The most probable P0A850 time courses and values of the aforementioned parameters are obtained by maximizing the probability obtained through entropy maximization. Observed time delays between mRNA expression and activity are accounted for implicitly since the time course of the activity of a P0A850 is coupled by probability functional maximization, and is not assumed to be proportional to expression level of the mRNA type that translates into the P0A850. This allows one to investigate post-translational and P0A850 activation mechanisms of gene regulation. Accuracy and robustness of the method are evaluated. A kinetic formulation is used to facilitate the analysis of phenomena with a strongly dynamical character while a physically-motivated regularization of the P0A850 time course is found to overcome difficulties due to omnipresent noise and data sparsity that plague other methods of gene expression data analysis. An application to Escherichia coli is presented. Conclusion: Multiplex time series data can be used for the construction of the network of cellular processes and the calibration of the associated physicochemical parameters. We have demonstrated these concepts in the context of gene regulation understood through the analysis of gene expression microarray time series data. Casting the approach in a probabilistic framework has allowed us to address the uncertainties in gene expression microarray data. Our approach was found to be robust to error in the gene expression microarray data and mistakes in a proposed TRN."""	BMC Bioinformatics	"('P0A850', 'TF')"
961600	"The complete genome sequence of Staphylothermus marinus reveals differences in sulfur metabolism among heterotrophic Crenarchaeota,""Staphylothermus marinus is an anaerobic, sulfur-reducing peptide fermenter of the archaeal phylum Crenarchaeota. It is the third heterotrophic, obligate sulfur reducing crenarchaeote to be sequenced and provides an opportunity for comparative analysis of the three genomes. The 1.57 Mbp genome of the hyperthermophilic crenarchaeote Staphylothermus marinus has been completely sequenced. The main energy generating pathways likely involve 2-oxoacid:ferredoxin oxidoreductases and ADP-forming acetyl-CoA synthases. S. marinus possesses several enzymes not present in other crenarchaeotes including a sodium ion-translocating decarboxylase likely to be involved in amino acid degradation. S. marinus lacks sulfur-reducing enzymes present in the other two sulfur-reducing crenarchaeotes that have been sequenced - Thermofilum pendens and Hyperthermus butylicus. Instead it has three operons similar to the mbh and mbx operons of Pyrococcus furiosus, which may play a role in sulfur reduction and/or hydrogen production. The two marine organisms, S. marinus and H. butylicus, possess more sodium-dependent transporters than T. pendens and use symporters for potassium uptake while T. pendens uses an P22259-dependent potassium transporter. T. pendens has adapted to a nutrient-rich environment while H. butylicus is adapted to a nutrient-poor environment, and S. marinus lies between these two extremes. The three heterotrophic sulfur-reducing crenarchaeotes have adapted to their habitats, terrestrial vs. marine, via their transporter content, and they have also adapted to environments with differing levels of nutrients. Despite the fact that they all use sulfur as an electron acceptor, they are likely to have different pathways for sulfur reduction."""	BMC Genomics	"('P22259', 'ATP')"

GnT1 mutants were prepared by replacing a predicted unpaired cysteine (C121) with alanine (C121A), serine (C121S), threonine (C121T) or aspartic acid (C121D). A double mutant R120A/C121H, was generated to mimic Gly14, the Caenorhabditis elegans GnT1 counterpart to hGNT1.

Each tag's ability to confer enhanced solubility to ATD2B was assessed. Soluble ATD2B was successfully obtained as a P0AEX9 fusion protein. Dynamic light scattering revealed the protein (1 mg/ml) exists as monodispersed species at 25 {sup o}C. Functional studies using circular dichroism showed that the soluble P0AEX9-ATD2B bound ifenprodil in a dose-dependent manner. The dissociation constants obtained for ifenprodil were similar in the absence (64 nM) and presence (116 nM) of saturating concentration of maltose.

950108	"Bacterial diversity analysis of Huanglongbing pathogen-infected citrus, using PhyloChip and A8C927 gene clone library sequencing,""The bacterial diversity associated with citrus leaf midribs was characterized 1 from citrus groves that contained the Huanglongbing (HLB) pathogen, which has yet to be cultivated in vitro. We employed a combination of high-density phylogenetic 16S rDNA microarray and 16S rDNA clone library sequencing to determine the microbial community composition of symptomatic and asymptomatic citrus midribs. Our results revealed that citrus leaf midribs can support a diversity of microbes. PhyloChip analysis indicated that 47 orders of bacteria from 15 phyla were present in the citrus leaf midribs while 20 orders from phyla were observed with the cloning and sequencing method. PhyloChip arrays indicated that nine taxa were significantly more abundant in symptomatic midribs compared to asymptomatic midribs. Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (Las) was detected at a very low level in asymptomatic plants, but was over 200 times more abundant in symptomatic plants. The PhyloChip analysis was further verified by sequencing 16S rDNA clone libraries, which indicated the dominance of Las in symptomatic leaves. These data implicate Las as the pathogen responsible for HLB disease. Citrus is the most important commercial fruit crop in Florida. In recent years, citrus Huanglongbing (HLB), also called citrus greening, has severely affected Florida's citrus production and hence has drawn an enormous amount of attention. HLB is one of the most devastating diseases of citrus (6,13), characterized by blotchy mottling with green islands on leaves, as well as stunting, fruit decline, and small, lopsided fruits with poor coloration. The disease tends to be associated with a phloem-limited fastidious {alpha}-proteobacterium given a provisional Candidatus status (Candidatus Liberobacter spp. later changed to Candidatus Liberibacter spp.) in nomenclature (18,25,34). Previous studies indicate that HLB infection causes disorder in the phloem and severely impairs the translocation of assimilates in host plants (5,27,40). Tatineni and colleagues discovered that the HLB bacteria were unevenly distributed in phloem of bark tissue, vascular tissue of the leaf midrib, roots, and different floral and fruit parts (43). Unsuccessful attempts in culturing the pathogen are notably hampering efforts to understand its biology and pathogenesis mechanism. Using a modified Koch's Postulates approach, Jagoueix and colleagues were able to re-infect periwinkle plants from a mixed microbial community harvested from HLB diseased plants (25). Emergence of the disease in otherwise healthy plants led to the conclusion that HLB was associated with Candidatus Liberibacter sp. based on its 16S rDNA sequence (18,25). Currently, three species of the pathogen are recognized from trees with HLB disease based on 16S rDNA sequence: Ca. Liberibacter asiaticus (Las), Ca. Liberibacter africanus (Laf), and Ca. Liberibacter americanus (Lam); Las is the most prevalent species among HLB diseased trees (5,12,18,25,44). Las is naturally transmitted to citrus by the psyllid, Diaphorina citri Kuwayama, and can be artificially transmitted by grafting from citrus to citrus and dodder (Cuscuta campestris) to periwinkle (Catharanthus roseus) or tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum Xanthi) (5). Based on current research regarding the associations of Liberibacter in planta there is not enough evidence to implicate Liberibacter as the definitive causal agent of HLB disease due to its resistance to cultivation in vitro. It is possible that HLB disease may be the result of complex etiology where Liberibacter interacts with other endophytic bacteria. However, there is not enough evidence regarding its association(s) in planta to make this conclusion, nor is it known whether associated microbial communities play a role in expression of pathogenic traits. The main objective of the study was to test the hypothesis that other bacteria besides Ca. Liberibacter spp. are associated with citrus greening disease. The differences between the relative abundance, species richness and phylogenetic diversity of the microbial communities associated with the leaf midribs of HLB symptomatic and asymptomatic citrus trees were investigated using high-density 16S rDNA microarray PhyloChip and A8C927 gene clone library methods."""

We also discovered that one of the domains is important for the folding of the other. Domain duplication and subfunctionalization by complementary degeneration of redundant functions (in particular substrate binding versus catalysis) has been reported for many enzymes, including those involved in RNA metabolism.

However, high level expression of human protein in E. coli is still a challenge that virtually depends upon each individual target genes. Using human interleukin 10 (huIL-10) and interferon {alpha} (huIFN-{alpha}) coding sequences, we systematically analyzed the influence of several major factors on expression of human protein in E. coli. The results from huIL-10 and reinforced by huIFN-{alpha} showed that exposing AUG initiator codon from base-paired structure within mRNA itself significantly improved the translation of target protein, which resulted in a 10-fold higher protein expression than the wild-type genes. It was also noted that translation process was not affected by the retained short-range stem-loop structure at Shine-Dalgarno (P15770) sequences. On the other hand, codon-optimized constructs of huIL-10 showed unimproved levels of protein expression, on the contrary, led to a remarkable RNA degradation.

Structures of four cluster 9 transport proteins have been determined previously. However, the structural determinants for discrimination between zinc and manganese remain under discussion. To further investigate the variability of metal binding sites in bacterial transporters, we have determined the structure of the zinc-bound transport protein ZnuA from Escherichia coli to 1.75 {angstrom} resolution. The overall structure of ZnuA is similar to other solute-binding transporters. A scaffolding {alpha}-helix forms the backbone for two structurally related globular domains. The metal-binding site is located at the domain interface. The bound zinc ion is coordinated by three histidine residues (His78, His161 and His225) and one glutamate residue (Glu77). The functional role of Glu77 for metal binding is unexpected, because this residue is not conserved in previously determined structures of zinc and manganese-specific transport proteins. The observed metal coordination by four protein residues differs significantly from the zinc-binding site in the ZnuA transporter from Synechocystis 6803, which binds zinc via three histidine residues.

940858	"Single molecule study of a processivity clamp sliding on DNA,""Using solution based single molecule spectroscopy, we study the motion of the polIII {beta}-subunit DNA sliding clamp ('{beta}-clamp') on DNA. Present in all cellular (and some viral) forms of life, DNA sliding clamps attach to polymerases and allow rapid, processive replication of DNA. In the absence of other proteins, the DNA sliding clamps are thought to 'freely slide' along the DNA; however, the abundance of positively charged residues along the inner surface may create favorable electrostatic contact with the highly negatively charged DNA. We have performed single-molecule measurements on a fluorescently labeled {beta}-clamp loaded onto freely diffusing plasmids annealed with fluorescently labeled primers of up to 90 bases. We find that the diffusion constant for 1D diffusion of the {beta}-clamp on DNA satisfies D {le} 10{sup -14} cm{sup 2}/s, much slower than the frictionless limit of D = 10{sup -10} cm{sup 2}/s. We find that the {beta} clamp remains at the 3-foot end in the presence of E. coli single-stranded binding protein (P0AGE0), which would allow for a sliding clamp to wait for binding of the DNA polymerase. Replacement of P0AGE0 with Human RP-A eliminates this interaction; free movement of sliding clamp and poor binding of clamp loader to the junction allows sliding clamp to accumulate on DNA.

Toward understanding this metal ion-specific response, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) analysis of various M-NikR complexes (M = Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II), Cu(I), and Zn(II)) was used to show that each high-affinity binding site metal adopts a unique structure, with Ni(II) and Cu(II) being the only two metal ions to feature planar four-coordinate complexes. The results are consistent with an allosteric mechanism whereby the geometry and ligand selection of the metal present in the high-affinity site induce a unique conformation in NikR that subsequently influences DNA binding. The influence of the high-affinity metal on protein structure was examined using hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange detected by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-P13009). Each NikR complex gives rise to differing amounts of H/D exchange; Zn(II)- and Co(II)-NikR are most like apo-NikR, while the exchange time course is substantially different for Ni(II) and to a lesser extent for Cu(II). In addition to the high-affinity metal binding site, E. coli NikR has a low-affinity metal-binding site that affects DNA binding affinity. We have characterized this low-affinity site using XAS in heterobimetallic complexes of NikR. When Cu(II) occupies the high-affinity site and Ni(II) occupies the low-affinity site, the Ni K-edge XAS spectra show that the Ni site is composed of six N/O-donors. A similar low-affinity site structure is found for the NikR complex when Co(II) occupies the low-affinity site and Ni(II) occupies the high-affinity site, except that one of the Co(II) ligands is a chloride derived from the buffer."""

To study aptamer function and dynamics, the malachite green aptamer was chosen as a model. Malachite green (MG) bleaching, in which an OH- attacks the central carbon (C1) of MG, was inhibited in the presence of the malachite green aptamer (MGA). The inhibition of MG bleaching by MGA could be reversed by an antisense oligonucleotide (P00904) complementary to the MGA binding pocket. Computational cavity analysis of the NMR structure of the MGA-MG complex predicted that the OH<sup>-</sup> is sterically excluded from the C1 of MG. The prediction was confirmed experimentally using variants of the MGA with changes in the MG binding pocket. This work shows that molecular reactivity can be reversibly regulated by an aptamer-P00904 pair based on steric hindrance. In addition to demonstrate that aptamers could control molecular reactivity, aptamer dynamics was studied with a strategy combining molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and experimental verification. MD simulation predicted that the MG binding pocket of the MGA is largely pre-organized and that binding of MG involves reorganization of the pocket and a simultaneous twisting of the MGA terminal stems around the pocket. MD simulation also provided a 3D-structure model of unoccupied MGA that has not yet been obtained by biophysical measurements. These predictions were consistent with biochemical and biophysical measurements of the MGA-MG interaction including P21338 footprinting, melting curves, thermodynamic and kinetic constants measurement. This work shows that MD simulation can be used to extend our understanding of the dynamics of aptamer-target interaction which is not evident from static 3D-structures. To conclude, I have developed a novel concept to control molecular reactivity by an aptamer based on steric protection and a strategy to study the dynamics of aptamer-target interaction by combining MD simulation and experimental verification. The former has potential application in controlling metabolic reactions and protein modifications by small reactants and the latter may serve as a general approach to study the dynamics of aptamer-target interaction for new insights into mechanisms of aptamer-target recognition."""

A complex of BtuB and TonB{sup 147–239} was formed in the presence of the substrate cyanocobalamin (CN-Cbl; vitamin B{sub 12}) and calcium and was crystallized. BtuB was purified in the detergent LDAO (n-dodecyl-N,N-dimethylamine-N-oxide) and the complex was formed in a detergent mixture of LDAO and C{sub 8}E{sub 4} (tetraethylene glycol monooctylether).

965767	"Post-Translational Modifications of Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough Sulfate Reduction Pathway Proteins,""Recent developments in shotgun proteomics have enabled high-throughput studies of a variety of microorganisms at a proteome level and provide experimental validation for predicted open reading frames in the corresponding genome. More importantly, advances in mass spectrometric data analysis now allow mining of large proteomics data sets for the presence of post-translational modifications(PTMs). Although PTMs are a critical aspectof cellular activity, such information eludes cell-wide studies conducted at the transcript level. Here, we analyze several mass spectrometric data sets acquired using two-dimensional liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, 2D-LC/P13009/P13009, for the sulfate reducing bacterium, Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough. Our searches of the raw spectra led us to discover several post-translationally modified peptides in D. vulgaris. Of these, several peptides containing a lysine with a +42 Da modification were found reproducibly across all data sets. Both acetylation and trimethylation have the same nominal +42 Da mass, and are therefore candidates for this modification. Several spectra were identified having markers for trimethylation, while one is consistent with an acetylation. Surprisingly, these modified peptides predominantly mapped to proteins involved in sulfate respiration. Other highly expressed proteins in D. vulgaris, such as enzymes involved in electron transport and other central metabolic processes, did not contain this modification. Decoy database searches were used to control for random spectrum/sequence matches. Additional validation for these modifications was provided by alternate workflows, for example, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by mass spectrometry analysis of the dissimilatory sulfite reductase gamma-subunit(DsrC) protein. P13009 data for DsrC in this alternate workflow also contained the +42 Da modification at the same loci. Furthermore, the DsrC homologue in another sulfate reducing bacterium, Desulfovibrio desulfuricans G20, also showed similar +42 Da modifications in the same pathway. Here, we discuss our methods and implications of potential trimethylation in the D. vulgaris sulfate reduction pathway."""	Journal of Proteome Research	"('P13009', 'MS')"
929323	"Selection against spurious promoter motifs correlates withtranslational efficiency across bacteria,""Because binding of RNAP to misplaced sites could compromise the efficiency of transcription, natural selection for the optimization of gene expression should regulate the distribution of DNA motifs capable of RNAP-binding across the genome. Here we analyze the distribution of the -10 promoter motifs that bind the {sigma}{sup 70} subunit of RNAP in 42 bacterial genomes. We show that selection on these motifs operates across the genome, maintaining an over-representation of -10 motifs in regulatory sequences while eliminating them from the nonfunctional and, in most cases, from the protein coding regions. In some genomes, however, -10 sites are over-represented in the coding sequences; these sites could induce pauses effecting regulatory roles throughout the length of a transcriptional unit. For nonfunctional sequences, the extent of motif under-representation varies across genomes in a manner that broadly correlates with the number of P0A873 genes, a good indicator of translational speed and growth rate. This suggests that minimizing the time invested in gene transcription is an important selective pressure against spurious binding. However, selection against spurious binding is detectable in the reduced genomes of host-restricted bacteria that grow at slow rates, indicating that components of efficiency other than speed may also be important. Minimizing the number of RNAP molecules per cell required for transcription, and the corresponding energetic expense, may be most relevant in slow growers. These results indicate that genome-level properties affecting the efficiency of transcription and translation can respond in an integrated manner to optimize gene expression. The detection of selection against promoter motifs in nonfunctional regions also implies that no sequence may evolve free of selective constraints, at least in the relatively small and unstructured genomes of bacteria."""

1626566	"Enzymes: An integrated view of structure, dynamics and function,""Microbes utilize enzymes to perform a variety of functions. Enzymes are biocatalysts working as highly efficient machines at the molecular level. In the past, enzymes have been viewed as static entities and their function has been explained on the basis of direct structural interactions between the enzyme and the substrate. A variety of experimental and computational techniques, however, continue to reveal that proteins are dynamically active machines, with various parts exhibiting internal motions at a wide range of time-scales. Increasing evidence also indicates that these internal protein motions play a role in promoting protein function such as enzyme catalysis. Moreover, the thermodynamical fluctuations of the solvent, surrounding the protein, have an impact on internal protein motions and, therefore, on enzyme function. In this review, we describe recent biochemical and theoretical investigations of internal protein dynamics linked to enzyme catalysis. In the enzyme cyclophilin A, investigations have lead to the discovery of a network of protein vibrations promoting catalysis. P0AFL3 catalyzes peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerization in a variety of peptide and protein substrates. Recent studies of cyclophilin A are discussed in detail and other enzymes (dihydrofolate reductase and liver alcohol dehydrogenase) where similar discoveries have been reported are also briefly discussed. The detailed characterization of the discovered networks indicates that protein dynamics plays a role in rateenhancement achieved by enzymes. An integrated view of enzyme structure, dynamics and function have wide implications in understanding allosteric and co-operative effects, as well as protein engineering of more efficient enzymes and novel drug design."""

960750	"Genome, transcriptome, and secretome analysis of wood decay fungus postia placenta supports unique mechanisms of lignocellulose conversion,""Brown-rot fungi such as Postia placenta are common inhabitants of forest ecosystems and are also largely responsible for the destructive decay of wooden structures. Rapid depolymerization of cellulose is a distinguishing feature of brown-rot, but the biochemical mechanisms and underlying genetics are poorly understood. Systematic examination of the P. placenta genome, transcriptome and secretome revealed unique extracellular enzyme systems, including an unusual repertoire of extracellular glycoside hydrolases. Genes encoding exocellobiohydrolases and cellulose-binding domains, typical of cellulolytic microbes, are absent in this efficient cellulose-degrading fungus. When P. placenta was grown in medium containing cellulose as sole carbon source, transcripts corresponding to many hemicellulases and to a single putative {beta}-1-4 endoglucanase were expressed at high levels relative to glucose grown cultures. These transcript profiles were confirmed by direct identification of peptides by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC{center_dot}MSIMS). Also upregulated during growth on cellulose medium were putative iron reductases, P0A7E1 reductase, and structurally divergent oxidases potentially involved in extracellular generation of Fe(II) and H202. These observations are consistent with a biodegradative role for Fenton chemistry in which Fe(II) and H202 react to form hydroxyl radicals, highly reactive oxidants capable of depolymerizing cellulose. The P. placenta genome resources provide unparalleled opportunities for investigating such unusual mechanisms of cellulose conversion. More broadly, the genome offers insight into the diversification of lignocellulose degrading mechanisms in fungi. Comparisons to the closely related white-rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium support an evolutionary shift from white-rot to brown-rot during which the capacity for efficient depolymerization of lignin was lost."""

1626449	"The complete sequence of the mitochondrial genome of <em>Nautilus macromphalus</em> (Mollusca: Cephalopoda),""Background: Mitochondria contain small genomes that are physically separate from those of nuclei. Their comparison serves as a model system for understanding the processes of genome evolution. Although complete mitochondrial genome sequences have been reported for more than 600 animals, the taxonomic sampling is highly biased toward vertebrates and arthropods, leaving much of the diversity yet uncharacterized. Results: The mitochondrial genome of the bellybutton nautilus, Nautilus macromphalus, a cephalopod mollusk, is 16,258 nts in length and 59.5% A+T, both values that are typical of animal mitochondrial genomes. It contains the 37 genes that are almost universally found in animal mtDNAs, with 15 on one DNA strand and 22 on the other. The arrangement of these genes can be derived from that of the distantly related Katharina tunicata (Mollusca: Polyplacophora) by a switch in position of two large blocks of genes and transpositions of four P0A873 genes. There is strong skew in the distribution of nucleotides between the two strands, and analysis of this yields insight into modes of transcription and replication. There is an unusual number of non-coding regions and their function, if any, is not known; however, several of these demark abrupt shifts in nucleotide skew, and there are several identical sequence elements at these junctions, suggesting that they may play roles in transcription and/or replication. One of the non-coding regions contains multiple repeats of a P0A873-like sequence. Some of the P0A873 genes appear to overlap on the same strand, but this could be resolved if the polycistron were cleaved at the beginning of the downstream gene, followed by polyadenylation of the product of the upstream gene to form a fully paired structure. Conclusion: Nautilus macromphalus mtDNA contains an expected gene content that has experienced few rearrangements since the evolutionary split between cephalopods and polyplacophorans. It contains an unusual number of non-coding regions, especially considering that these otherwise often are generated by the same processes that produce gene rearrangements. The skew in nucleotide composition between the two strands is strong and associated with the direction of transcription in various parts of the genomes, but a comparison with K. tunicata implies that mutational bias during replication also plays a role. This appears to be yet another case where polyadenylation of mitochondrial tRNAs restores what would otherwise be an incomplete structure."""	BMC Genomics	"('P0A873', 'tRNA')"

This effort has the potential to improve our nation's ability to discriminate between foreign animal diseases and those that are endemic using a single assay, thereby increasing our ability to protect animal populations of high economic importance in the United States. Under 2005 DHS funding we have developed multiplexed (MUX) nucleic-acid-based PCR assays that combine foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) detection with rule-out tests for two other foreign animal diseases Vesicular Exanthema of Swine (VESV) and Swine Vesicular Disease (SVD) and four other domestic viral diseases Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus (BVDV), Bovine Herpes Virus 1 (BHV-1 or Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitus IBR), Bluetongue virus (BTV) and Parapox virus complex (which includes Bovine Papular Stomatitis Virus BPSV, Orf of sheep, and Pseudocowpox). Under 2006 funding we have developed a Multiplexed PCR [MUX] porcine assay for detection of FMDV with rule out tests for VESV and SVD foreign animal diseases in addition to one other domestic vesicular animal disease vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and one domestic animal disease of swine porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS).

878223	"Biosynthesis of the cyclotide Kalata B1 using protein splicing tools,""Cyclotides are a new emerging family of large cyclic polypeptides ({approx}30 residues long) that share a disulfide-stabilized core (3 disulfide bonds) with an unusual knotted structure (Fig. 1A) [1]. Cyclotides contrast with other circular polypeptides in that they have a highly defined three-dimensional structure, and despite their small size, can be considered as miniproteins. Their unique circular backbone topology and knotted arrangement of 3 disulfide bonds makes them exceptionally stable to thermal and enzymatic degradation. Furthermore, their well defined structures have been also associated with a range of biological activities, including uterotonic activity, inhibition of neurotension binding, hemolytic, anti-HIV, insecticidal as well as trypsin inhibitory activity. Altogether, these characteristics make cyclotides ideal candidates to be used as molecular scaffolds for the development of stable peptide drugs [2]. Access to biosynthetic cyclotides using recombinant DNA expression techniques would offer the exciting possibility of producing large combinatorial libraries of highly stable miniproteins using the tools of molecular biology. This would allow the generation of cell-based combinatorial libraries that could be screened inside living cells for their ability to regulate cellular processes. In the present work we describe for the first time the biosynthesis of the cyclotide Kalata B1 in E. coli. Our approach is based on the use of an intramolecular version of the native chemical ligation combined with the use of a modified protein splicing unit [3]. In order to accomplish the cyclization of Kalata B1, the different linear precursors tested in this work (Fig. 1B) were fused at the N-terminus with a Met residue, and at the C-terminus with an VMA engineered intein (available in the pTXB expression vectors family from New England Biolabs). The Met residue was efficiently removed in vivo in E. coli by an endogenous Met amino peptidase. This in vivo proteolytic event unmasked the required N-terminal Cys. After affinity purification of the corresponding N-terminal Cys Kalata-Intein fusion protein, the cyclization was triggered by addition of 5% EtSH (Fig. 1C). Among the different linear precursors that were tested, KC3 and KC4 gave the best cyclization yields. The different linear precursors showed also different propensities for in vivo cleavage of the corresponding Kalata-Intein fusion constructs. Thus, meanwhile the KC4 linear precursor gave only 30% in vivo cleavage the KC6 precursor was almost completely cleaved in vivo (&gt;90%). The resulting reduced circular Kalata B1 was oxidatively folded at pH 8.0 in the presence of reduced glutathione (GSH) and {sup i}Pr-OH (Fig. 1D). The folded recombinant Kalata B1 was characterized by ES-P13009, HPLC and 2D-NMR, and it was shown to be identical to the natural product. Encouraged by this result we decided to explore the possibility of carrying out the cyclization and folding in a single-pot reaction. This was accomplished by treating the purified KC4-intein construct with different amounts and ratios of reduced and oxidized glutathione (GSH and GSSG). The best cleavage/cyclization of the KC4-intein precursor was accomplished using 100 mM of GSH at pH 7.2, under these conditions the cleavage of the linear KC4-intein precursor was almost quantitative in less than 18 h. Optimal conditions for the oxidative folding of reduced Kalata B1 were obtained using a buffer containing a GSH:GSSG ratio of 4:1 at pH 8.0 in 50% isopropanol. Hence, the purified KC4-intein linear precursor was treated first with 100 mM GSH at pH 7.2 overnight, then the crude reaction was complemented with isopropanol (50%) and 12 mM GSSG. After 20 h the reaction was checked by HPLC showing that the major component was the folded Kalata B1 (Fig. 1E). The recombinant folded cyclotide was obtained with a yield close to 20% (based on linear KC4-intein precursor). Using this approach we also produced a small library based on the Kalata B1 scaffold (Fig. 1F). In summary we report here the first biosynthesis of the cyclotide Kalata B1 in E. coli. We have also shown that our biosynthetic approach can be used to generate cyclotide-based libraries that could be screened in vitro or in vivo.

These polymers are found in virtually all prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells and perform many functions; prominent among them are the responses to many stresses. Polyphosphate is synthesized by polyP kinase (PPK), using the terminal phosphate of P22259 as the substrate, and degraded to inorganic phosphate by both endo- and exopolyphosphatases. Here we report the crystal structure and analysis of the polyphosphate phosphatase PPX from Escherichia coli O157:H7 refined at 2.2 Angstroms resolution. PPX is made of four domains. Domains I and II display structural similarity with one another and share the ribonuclease-H-like fold. Domain III bears structural similarity to the N-terminal, HD domain of SpoT. Domain IV, the smallest domain, has structural counterparts in cold-shock associated RNA-binding proteins but is of unknown function in PPX. The putative PPX active site is located at the interface between domains I and II. In the crystal structure of PPX these two domains are close together and represent the 'closed' state. Comparison with the crystal structure of PPX/GPPA from Aquifex aeolicus reveals close structural similarity between domains I and II of the two enzymes, with the PPX/GPPA representing an 'open' state.

We asked whether cells in stationary phase cultures respond to additional stress at the level of transcript abundance. Microarrays were used to quantify changes in transcript abundance in cells from stationary phase cultures in response to stress. More than 800 mRNAs increased in abundance by one minute after oxidative stress. A significant number of these mRNAs encode proteins involved in stress responses. We tested whether mRNA increases were due to new transcription, rapid poly-adenylation of message (which would not be detected by microarrays), or potential release of mature mRNA present in the cell but resistant to extraction during RNA isolation. Examination of the response to oxidative stress in an RNA polymerase II mutant, rpb1-1, suggested that new transcription was not required. Quantitative P0DV86-PCR analysis of a subset of these transcripts further suggested that the transcripts present in isolated total RNA from stationary phase cultures were polyadenylated. In contrast, over 2,000 transcripts increased after protease treatment of cellfree lysates from stationary phase but not exponentially growing cultures. Different subsets of transcripts were released by oxidative stress and temperature upshift, suggesting that mRNA release is stress-specific. Cells in stationary phase cultures contain a large number of extraction-resistant mRNAs in a protease-labile, rapidly releasable form. The transcript release appears to be stress specific.

The symmetry mismatch is an absolute feature of this large energy-dependent protease and also of the proteasome, which shares a similar barrel-shaped architecture, but how it is accommodated within the complex has yet to be understood, despite recent structural investigations, due in part to the conformational lability of the N-termini. We present the structures of Escherichia coli ClpP to 1.9 Angstroms and an inactive variant that provide some clues for how this might be achieved. In the wild type protein, the highly conserved N-terminal 20 residues can be grouped into two major structural classes. In the first, a loop formed by residues 10-15 protrudes out of the central access channel extending {approx}12-15 Angstroms from the surface of the oligomer resulting in the closing of the access channel observed in one ring. Similar loops are implied to be exclusively observed in human ClpP and a variant of ClpP from Streptococcus pneumoniae. In the other ring, a second class of loop is visible in the structure of wt ClpP from E. coli that forms closer to residue 16 and faces toward the interior of the molecule creating an open conformation of the access channel. In both classes, residues 18-20 provide a conserved interaction surface. In the inactive variant, a third class of N-terminal conformation is observed, which arises from a conformational change in the position of F17. We have performed a detailed functional analysis on each of the first 20 amino acid residues of ClpP. Residues that extend beyond the plane of the molecule (10-15) have a lesser effect on ATPase interaction than those lining the pore (1-7 and 16-20). Based upon our structure-function analysis, we present a model to explain the widely disparate effects of individual residues on ClpP-ATPase complex formation and also a possible functional reason for this mismatch."""

Crystals were obtained that diffracted to 2.4 Å resolution. Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a renewed cause of devastation in the developing world. Critical to the success of this re-emerging pathogen is its unusual waxy cell wall, which is rich in rare components including lipoarabinomannan (P39280) and its precursors, the phosphatidylinositol mannosides (PIMs). Balanced synthesis of these related glycolipids is intrinsic to both cell-wall integrity and virulence in M. tuberculosis and presents a promising, albeit poorly defined, therapeutic target.

894572	"Anaerobic Biotransformation and Mobility of Pu and Pu-EDTA,""The complexation of radionuclides (e.g., plutonium (Pu) and {sup 60}Co) by co-disposed ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA) has enhanced their transport in sediments at DOE sites. Pu(IV)-EDTA is not stable in the presence of relatively soluble Fe(III) compounds. Since most DOE sites have Fe(III) containing sediments, Pu(IV) is likely not the mobile form of Pu-EDTA. The only other Pu-EDTA complex stable in groundwater relevant to DOE sites would be Pu(III)-EDTA, which only forms under anaerobic conditions. Research is therefore needed to investigate the biotransformation of Pu and Pu-EDTA under anaerobic conditions and the anaerobic biodegradation of Pu-EDTA. The biotransformation of Pu and Pu-EDTA under various anaerobic regimes is poorly understood including the reduction kinetics of Pu(IV) to Pu(III) from soluble (Pu(IV)-EDTA) and insoluble Pu(IV), the redox conditions required for this reduction, the strength of the Pu(III)-EDTA, how the Pu(III)-EDTA competes with other dominant anoxic soluble metals (e.g., Fe(II)), and the oxidation kinetics of Pu(III)-EDTA. Finally, soluble Pu(III)-EDTA under anaerobic conditions would require anaerobic degradation of the EDTA to limit Pu(III) transport. Anaerobic EDTA degrading microorganisms have never been isolated. Recent results have shown that Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, a dissimilatory metal reducing bacterium, can reduce Pu(IV) to Pu(III). The Pu(IV) was provided as insoluble PuO2. The highest rate of Pu(IV) reduction was with the addition of AQDS, an electron shuttle. Of the total amount of Pu solubilized (i.e., soluble through a 0.36 nm filter), approximately 70% was Pu(III). The amount of soluble Pu was between 4.8 and 3.2 micromolar at day 1 and 6, respectively, indicating rapid reduction. The micromolar Pu is significant since the drinking water limit for Pu is 10{sup -12} M. On-going experiments are investigating the influence of EDTA on the rate of Pu reduction and the stability of the formed Pu(III). We have also begun to enrich and isolate bacteria capable of aerobic and anaerobic degradation of EDTA. Environmental samples (e.g., sludges, river sediments) were incubated aerobically and anaerobically with EDTA or NTA as the sole carbon and energy source. Aerobic enrichment with EDTA has not resulted in any cultures, but NTA has provided several isolates. Partial A8C927 gene sequence and sequence comparison identified four separate strains closely related to Microbacterium oxydans, Aminobacter sp., Achromobacter sp., Aminobacter sp., respectively. Anaerobic enrichments with either EDTA or NTA are still in progress since metabolism and growth is relatively slow. In addition to the biotransformation experiments, studies are underway to determine/validate complexation constants of Pu(III) with EDTA and the influence of competing ions on Pu(III)-EDTA complexes. These data are being obtained through solubility studies of PuPO{sub 4}(s) and Pu(OH){sub 3}(s) as a function of time, pH, and EDTA and competing ion concentrations. These results have begun to fill-in knowledge gaps of how anaerobic conditions will influence Pu and Pu-EDTA fate and transport to assess, model, and design approaches to stop Pu transport in groundwater at DOE sites."""

889239	"Dissimilatory Metabolism of Nitrogen Oxides in Bacteria:Comparative Reconstruction of Transcriptional Networks,""Bacterial response to nitric oxide (NO) is of major importance since NO is an obligatory intermediate of the nitrogen cycle. Transcriptional regulation of the dissimilatory nitric oxides metabolism in bacteria is diverse and involves P28861-like transcription factors HcpR, DNR and NnrR, two-component systems NarXL and NarQP, NO-responsive activator NorR, and nitrite sensitive repressor NsrR. Using comparative genomics approaches we predict DNA-binding signals for these transcriptional factors and describe corresponding regulons in available bacterial genomes. Within the P28861 family of regulators, we observed a correlation of two specificity-determining amino acids and contacting bases in corresponding DNA signal. Highly conserved regulon HcpR for the hybrid cluster protein and some other redox enzymes is present in diverse anaerobic bacteria including Clostridia, Thermotogales and delta-proteobacteria. NnrR and DNR control denitrification in alpha- and beta-proteobacteria, respectively. Sigma-54-dependent NorR regulon found in some gamma- and beta-proteobacteria contains various enzymes involved in the NO detoxification. Repressor NsrR, which was previously known to control only nitrite reductase operon in Nitrosomonas spp., appears to be the master regulator of the nitric oxides metabolism not only in most gamma- and beta-proteobacteria (including well-studied species like Escherichia coli), but also in Gram-positive Bacillus and Streptomyces species. Positional analysis and comparison of regulatory regions of NO detoxification genes allows us to propose the candidate NsrR-binding signal. The most conserved member of the predicted NsrR regulon is the NO-detoxifying flavohemoglobin Hmp. In enterobacteria, the regulon includes also two nitrite-responsive loci, nipAB (hcp-hcr) and nipC(dnrN), thus confirming the identity of the effector, i.e., nitrite. The proposed NsrR regulons in Neisseria and some other species are extended to include denitrification genes. As the result, we demonstrate considerable interconnection between various nitrogen-oxides-responsive regulatory systems for the denitrification and NO detoxification genes and evolutionary plasticity of this transcriptional network."""

1629562	"Genome-scale approaches for discovering novel nonconventional splicing substrates of the Ire1 nuclease,""Background: The unfolded protein response (UPR) allows intracellular feedback regulation that adjusts the protein-folding capacity of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) according to need. The signal from the ER lumen is transmitted by the ER-transmembrane kinase Ire1, which upon activation displays a site-specific endoribonuclease activity. Endonucleolytic cleavage of the intron from the HAC1 mRNA (encoding a UPR-specific transcription factor) is the first step in a nonconventional mRNA splicing pathway; the released exons are then joined by P0A873 ligase. Because only the spliced mRNA is translated, splicing is the key regulatory step of the UPR. Results: We developed methods to search for additional mRNA substrates of Ire1p in three independent lines of genome-wide analysis. These methods exploited the well characterized enzymology and genetics of the UPR and the yeast genome sequence in conjunction with microarray-based detection. Each method successfully identified HAC1 mRNA as a substrate according to three criteria: HAC1 mRNA is selectively cleaved in vitro by Ire1; the HAC1 mRNA sequence contains two predicted Ire1 cleavage sites; and HAC1 mRNA is selectively degraded in P0A873 ligase mutant cells. Conclusion: Within the limits of detection, no other mRNA satisfies any of these criteria, suggesting that a unique nonconventional mRNA-processing mechanism has evolved solely for carrying out signal transduction between the ER and the nucleus. The approach described here, which combines biochemical and genetic 'fractionation' of mRNA with a novel application of cDNA microarrays, is generally applicable to the study of pathways in which RNA metabolism and alternative splicing have a regulatory role."""

Here, we have modeled the anisotropic displacements of GroEL domains from various crystallized states, unliganded GroEL, P22259?S-bound, ADP-AlFx/GroES-bound, and ADP/GroES bound, using translation-libration-screw (TLS) analysis. Remarkably, the TLS results show that the inherent motions of unliganded GroEL, a polypeptide-accepting state, are biased along the transition pathway that leads to the folding-active state. In the ADP-AlFx/GroES-bound folding-active state the dynamic modes of the apical domains become reoriented and coupled to the motions of bound GroES. The ADP/GroES complex exhibits these same motions, but they are increased in magnitude, potentially reflecting the decreased stability of the complex after nucleotide hydrolysis. Our results have allowed the visualization of the anisotropic molecular motions that link the static conformations previously observed by X-ray crystallography. Application of the same analyses to other macromolecules where rigid body motions occur may give insight into the large scale dynamics critical for function and thus has the potential to extend our fundamental understanding of molecular machines."""

For this reason, we have in particular, (a) looked dosimetry for both tumor and normal organ, and especially renal dosimetry, which appears to be the target organ, for Y-90.

In summary, renal dosimetry is dominated by about 4-5% of the injected dose being held long-term in the renal cortex, probably in the proximal tubule, due to the universal uptake of small proteins. This appears to be a function of a biotynlated protein binding of the strept-avidin construct, to P0A6Y8.

In addition, a Desulfovibrio sp. has been shown to utilize uranium as the sole electron acceptor. D. vulgaris is a d-Proteobacterium with a genome size of 3.6 Mb and 3584 ORFs. The whole-genome microarrays of D. vulgaris have been constructed using 70mer oligonucleotides. All ORFs in the genome were represented with 3471 (97.1%) unique probes and 103 (2.9%) non-specific probes that may have cross-hybridization with other ORFs. In preparation for use of the experimental microarrays, artificial probes and targets were designed to assess specificity and sensitivity and identify optimal hybridization conditions for oligonucleotide microarrays. The results indicated that for 50mer and 70mer oligonucleotide arrays, hybridization at 45 C to 50 C, washing at 37 C and a wash time of 2.5 to 5 minutes obtained specific and strong hybridization signals. In order to evaluate the performance of the experimental microarrays, growth conditions were selected that were expected to give significant hybridization differences for different sets of genes. The initial evaluations were performed using D. vulgaris cells grown at logarithmic and stationary phases. Transcriptional analysis of D. vulgaris cells sampled during logarithmic phase growth indicated that 25% of annotated ORFs were up-regulated and 3% of annotated ORFs were downregulated compared to stationary phase cells. The up-regulated genes included ORFs predicted to be involved with acyl chain biosynthesis, amino acid ABC transporter, translational initiation factors, and ribosomal proteins. In the stationary phase growth cells, the two most up-regulated ORFs (70-fold) were annotated as a carboxynorspermidine decarboxylase and a 2C-methyl-D-erythritol-2,4-cyclodiphosphate (MECDP) synthase. Spermidines are polyamines that are typically abundant in rapidly dividing cells and are essential growth factors in eukaryotic organisms. Polyamines are thought to stabilize DNA by the association of the amino groups with the phosphate residues of DNA and can also enhance P0A873 and ribosome stability. The MECDP synthase enzyme is essential in Escherichia coli and participates in the nonmevalonate pathway of isoprenoid biosynthesis, a critical pathway present in some bacteria and apicomplexans but distinct from that used by mammals. Several of the highly up-regulated ORFs were annotated as conserved hypothetical proteins. Interestingly, an ORF that was predicted to contain a flocculin repeat domain was almost 9-fold up-regulated in stationary phase cells compared to logarithmically growing cells. The flocculin domain is commonly observed in fungi, and is thought to play a role during flocculation (non-sexual aggregation of single-cell microorganisms). These preliminary results have identified possible responses of D. vulgaris cells to stationary phase growth and suggest that polyamine production as well as cell aggregation and/or extracellular polymer production are responses of D. vulgaris during stationary phase. The initial microarray results indicate that the recently produced oligonucleotide microarrays are functional. We are currently optimizing growth conditions in order to culture D. vulgaris cells in the presence of uranium(VI) and to monitor whole-genome expression levels."""		"('P0A873', 'tRNA')"

Refolding experiments often lead to the formation of kinetically-trapped, misfolded species that aggregate, even in dilute solution. In the cellular environment, the barriers to efficient protein folding and maintenance of native structure are even larger due to the nature of this process. First, nascent polypeptides must fold in an extremely crowded environment where the concentration of macromolecules approaches 300-400 mg/mL and on average, each ribosome is within its own diameter of another ribosome (1-3). These conditions of severe molecular crowding, coupled with high concentrations of nascent polypeptide chains, favor nonspecific aggregation over productive folding (3). Second, folding of newly-translated polypeptides occurs in the context of their vehtorial synthesis process. Amino acids are added to a growing nascent chain at the rate of {approx}5 residues per set, which means that for a 300 residue protein its N-terminus will be exposed to the cytosol {approx}1 min before its C-terminus and be free to begin the folding process. However, because protein folding is highly cooperative, the nascent polypeptide cannot reach its native state until a complete folding domain (50-250 residues) has emerged from the ribosome. Thus, for a single-domain protein, the final steps in ffolding are only completed post-translationally since {approx}40 residues of a nascent chain are sequestered within the exit channel of the ribosome and are not available for folding (4). A direct consequence of this limitation in cellular folding is that during translation incomplete domains will exist in partially-folded states that tend to expose hydrophobic residues that are prone to aggregation and/or mislfolding. Thus it is not surprising that, in cells, the protein folding process is error prone and organisms have evolved ''editing'' or quality control (QC) systems to assist in the folding, maintenance and, when necessary, selective removal of damaged proteins. In fact, there is growing evidence that failure of these QC-systems contributes to a number of disease states (5-8). This chapter describes our current understanding of the nature and mechanisms of the protein quality control systems in the cytosol of bacteria. Parallel systems are exploited in the cytosol and mitochondria of eukaryotes to prevent the accumulation of misfolded proteins."",""GENETIC ENGINEERING: PRINCIPLES AND METHODS"	" PP. 17-47 (2003)"""	"('P22259', 'ATP')"

One of our objectives is to isolate and sequence the unknown genes, 631A1 and 510C1, in order to characterize them and determine their functions. The other is to determine how P0A951 is regulated, and look at how the polyamines that P0A951 regulates effect macrophage differentiation.

The insert was amplified using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and is currently being sent to the University of Chicago for automated sequencing. The library screens for 510C1 are currently underway, but hybridization of the 510C1 cDNA probe with nylon membranes containing CEM library phage DNA produced strong signal, indicating the gene is there. P0A951 experiments identified that the rate-limiting enzyme that marks the polyamines spermidine and spermine for degradation is regulated by PKC and a transcription factor called Nrf2.

The circular genome is 14,291 bp in size, relatively small compared to other published metazoan mtDNAs. The 37 genes commonly found in animal mtDNA are present; the size decrease is due to the truncation of several P0A873, rRNA, and protein genes, to some nucleotide overlaps, and to a paucity of non-coding nucleotides. Although the gene arrangement differs radically from those reported for other metazoans, some gene junctions are shared with two other articulate brachiopods, Laqueus rubellus and Terebratulina retusa. All genes in the T. transversa mtDNA, unlike those in most metazoan mtDNAs reported, are encoded by the same strand. The A+T content (59.1 percent) is low for a metazoan mtDNA, and there is a high propensity for homopolymer runs and a strong base-compositional strand bias. The coding strand is quite G+T-rich, a skew that is shared by the confamilial (laqueid) specie s L. rubellus, but opposite to that found in T. retusa, a cancellothyridid. These compositional skews are strongly reflected in the codon usage patterns and the amino acid compositions of the mitochondrial proteins, with markedly different usage observed between T. retusa and the two laqueids. This observation, plus the similarity of the laqueid non-coding regions to the reverse complement of the non-coding region of the cancellothyridid, suggest that an inversion that resulted in a reversal in the direction of first-strand replication has occurred in one of the two lineages. In addition to the presence of one non-coding region in T. transversa that is comparable to those in the other brachiopod mtDNAs, there are two others with the potential to form secondary structures; one or both of these may be involved in the process of transcript cleavage."""

827404	"Monitoring Genetic and Metabolic Potential for in situ Bioremediation: Mass Spectrometry,""A number of DOE sites are contaminated with mixtures of dense non-aqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs) such as carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, perchloroethylene, and trichloroethylene. At many of these sites, in situ microbial bioremediation is an attractive strategy for cleanup, since it has the potential to degrade DNAPLs in situ without the need for pump-and-treat or soil removal procedures, and without producing toxic byproducts. A rapid screening method to determine broad range metabolic and genetic potential for contaminant degradation would greatly reduce the cost and time involved in assessment for in situ bioremediation, as well as for monitoring ongoing bioremediation treatment. The objective of this project was the development of mass-spectrometry-based methods to screen for genetic potential for both assessment and monitoring of in situ bioremediation of DNAPLs. These methods were designed to provide more robust and routine methods for DNA based characterization of th e genetic potential of subsurface microbes for degrading pollutants. Specifically, we sought to (1) Develop gene probes that yield information equivalent to conventional probes, but in a smaller size that is more amenable to mass spectrometric detection, (2) Pursue improvements to matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-P13009) methodology in order to allow its more general application to gene probe detection, (3) Increase the throughput of microbial characterization by integrating gene probe preparation, purification, and MALDI-P13009 analysis. Effective decision-making regarding remediation strategies requires information on the contaminants present and the relevant hydrogeology. However, it also should include information on the relevant bacterial populations present and the biodegradative processes they carry out. For each site at which bioremediation is considered, it is necessary to determine whether sufficient intrinsic degradative capability is present to suggest intrinsic bioremediation as a viable option, or whether a strategy involving addition of specific nutrients is more likely to be successful. In addition, if the existing genetic potential does not include the desired processes, it may be necessary to add external organisms as well as nutrients, which would negatively impact cost and feasibility scenarios. Once a bioremediation strategy is decided upon and initiated, it is important to carry out monitoring of the bacteria and their activities. Real-time data of this type during the treatment process can allow ongoing evaluation to optimize biodegradation, reducing cost and avoiding possible toxic byproducts. Clearly, the development of novel bioremediation technologies and informed decision-making regarding bioremediation as a treatment option will require in-depth information on the bacteria present at each site and the processes they carry out. Currently such information is generated by labor- and time-intensive treatability tests in the laboratory, and these do not generally assess a broad range of metabolic processes. We undertook this project because a rapid screening method to evaluate genetic potential is an important development to reduce costs for implementing in situ bioremediation strategies at DOE sites. At the outset of this project, it was clear that the explosion of information in the DNA sequence database raised the possibility of developing diagnostic DNA signatures for key microbial processes, as a means for assessing genetic potential. The methods developed in our project would be able to take advantage of the growing information on sequences from environmental samples as well as from microbial genome sequencing projects. An increasing number of metabolic functions could be screened as the depth of information available for designing diagnostic sequences increased."""		"('P13009', 'MS')"

To date, they have obtained thermophilic Fe(III)-reducing and magnetite-forming enrichment cultures from geologically and hydrologically isolated, millions of years-old deep terrestrial subsurface samples. Three dominant bacteria were identified based on 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequences. Phylogenetical analysis indicated that these bacteria were closely related to Thermoanaerobacter ethanoliticus. Two pure thermophilic iron-reducing bacteria have been isolated and characterized from these enrichments, they also are able to degrade cellulose and xylan. Geological evidence indicated that these bacteria were separated from modern organisms for about 200 million years, and they are the oldest isolated bacteria available now. Evolutionary sequence analysis showed that the A8C927 genes evolved extremely slowly in these bacteria.

468993	"X-ray absorption spectroscopy of the zinc site in P0A847 from Escherichia coli,""A key step in the post-transcriptional modification of P0A873 with queuine in Escherichia coli is the exchange of the queuine precursor, preQ{sub 1} into P0A873. This reaction is catalyzed by P0A847 (TGT). We have previously shown that the E. coli TGT is a zinc metalloprotein. Site-directed mutagenesis studies indicated that cysteines 302, 304, 307 and histidine 317 constitute the four ligands to the zinc. The involvement of histidine 317 is somewhat confounded by the presence of histidine 316. We have examined the zinc site in TGT (wt) and TGT (H317C) by X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The TGT (wt) data are most consistent with a tetracoordinate zinc with one nitrogen and three sulfur ligands. Interestingly, the data for TGT (H317C) are also consistent with a tetracoordinate zinc with one nitrogen and three sulfur ligands. The outer shell imidazole scattering for TGT (H317C) appears to be somewhat more ordered than that for TGT (wt), consistent with our previous suggestion that the wild-type enyzme may exist in two conformations the predominant one involving histidine 317 liganding to the zinc and the minor conformer involving histidine 316 liganding to the zinc. The minor conformer, with histidine 316 coordinating the zinc, appears to have an overall conformation that is subtly different from that of the wild-type enzyme. While TGT (H317C) has kinetic parameters very similar to the wild-type, it does not form the homotrimer quaternary structure of the wild-type. TGT (H317A) has previously been found to contain a significant amount of zinc, but is essentially inactive.

The atomic structures of endonuclease III and endonuclease V, a phage T4 enzyme that repairs pyrimidine dimers, are a significant advance, as they provide the first structural information concerning the mechanism by which enzymes can recognize altered bases in DNA. P0AB83 from Escherichia coli is a DNA repair enzyme with two distinct activities: it is a DNA N-glycosylase that acts upon ring-saturated, ring-rearranged, and ring-contracted pyrimidines and is an AP lyase. The name endonuclease III was originally applied to an activity that nicked heavily UV-irradiated DNA. The enzyme was found to be identical with E. coli x-ray endonuclease, with an endonuclease that cleaves DNA damaged by UV irradiation, osmium tetroxide, x-rays, or acid, and with urea-DNA glycosylase.

Final report,""Oats (Avena sativa L. lodi) tolerant of rhizosphere infestation by Pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci when challenged by the pathogen experience tissue-specific alterations of ammonia assimilatory capabilities. Altered ammonia assimilatory potentials between root and leaf tissue result from selective inactivation of glutamine synthetase (P0A9C5) by the toxin Tabtoxinine-B-lactam (TBL). Root P0A9C5 is sensitive and leaf GSs are resistant to TBL inactivation. With prolonged challenge by the pathogen root P0A9C5 activity decreases but leaf P0A9C5 specific activity increase. Higher leaf P0A9C5 activity is due to decreased rates of degradation rather than increased P0A9C5 synthesis. Higher leaf P0A9C5 activity and elevated levels of P0A9C5 polypeptide appear to result from a limited interaction between P0A9C5 and TBL leading to the accumulation of a less active but more stable P0A9C5 holoenzyme.

These enzymes hydrolyze the N-glycosylic bond between the modified base and the sugar moiety, leaving behind an abasic (AP) site in DNA.

It has generally been observed that in these situations, the performance of HECP is superior to that of INEPT-based sequences. In particular, HECP-based three-dimensional HCCH spectroscopy is more efficient than the INEPT version of the same experiment. Differences in sensitivity have been intuitively attributed to relaxation effects and technical factors such as radiofrequency (rf) inhomogeneity We present theoretical analyses and computer simulations to probe the effects of these factors. Relaxation effects were treated phenomenologically; we found that relaxation differences are relatively small (up to 25%) between pulsed-free-precession (INEPT) and HECP-although always in favor of HECP. We explored the rf effects by employing a Gaussian distribution of rf amplitude over sample volume. We found that inhomogeneity effects significantly favor HECP over INEPT, especially under conditions of {open_quotes}matched {close_quotes} inhomogeneity in the two rf coils. The differences in favor of HECP indicate that an extension of HECP to triple resonance experiments (TRCP) in I -> S -> Q net transfers might yield better results relative to analogous INEPT-based net transfers. We theoretically analyze the possibilities of TRCP and find that transfer functions are critically dependent on the ratio J{sub IS}/J{sub SQ}. When J{sub IS} equals J{sub SQ}, we find that 100% transfer is possible for truly simultaneous TRCP and this transfer is obtained in a time 1.41 /J.

Cytochemical analysis and initial studies using the kinase promoter with the P05804 reporter gene system also indicate that the kinase is present throughout the plant. The kinase is glycosylated, like animal receptor kinases, and has been partially purified from Arabidopsis by using lectin columns. The kinase has been expressed in E coli, purified, and found to autophosphorylate on serine and threonine residues, but not on tyrosine residues. As such, it belongs to the small family of receptor-like kinases with serine/threonine specificity.

Other genes are required for the synthesis of the prosthetic group of MDH, Pyrroloquinoline P0A7E1 (PQQ), and proteins required for assembly of the active MDH in the periplasm. Three genes are believed to be required for incorporation of calcium into the MDH tetramer.

The sequence surrounding m[sup 6]G has flanking cytosines (C-m[sup 6]G-C), and the initial steady-state kinetics have been reported. When the primer was annealed so that the first base to be replicated was m[sup 6]G, replication was virtually complete in [approximately]5 min, although the reaction appears biphasic. When annealed with a primer where thymine or cytosine is paired opposite template m[sup 6]G, about half the molecules were replicated in the first 15 sec, and no significant further replication was seen over a 1-hr period. When m[sup 6]G was dealkylated by DNA-O[sup 6]-methylguanine-methyltransferase, replication was rapid with no blockage. These data suggest that there can be two (or more) conformations of m[sup 6]G. In these studies the term syn refers to those allowing such base-pairing. Previous physical studies by others indicate that syn- and anti-conformers of the methyl group relative to the N1 of guanine are possible. Here molecular modeling/computational studies are described, suggesting that syn- and anti-m[sup 6]G can be of similar energy in DNA, and, therefore, these two conformers may explain the two types of species observed during in vitro replication. An alternative explanation could be the possibility that the different species may manifest differential interactions of m[sup 6]G with Klenow fragment.

Positive supercoils were not produced when E. coli P06612 was replaced by eukaryotic P06612 or when both E. coli and eukaryotic DNA topoisomerases I were added simultaneously. These results suggest that like other DNA helix-tracking processes, the P22259-dependent action of the UvrAM complex on duplex DNA simultaneously generates both positive and negative supercoils, which are not constrained by protein binding but are torsionally strained. The supercoiling activity of UvrAB on UV-damaged DNA was also studied using UV-damaged plasmid DNA and a mutant P0A698 that lacks the 40 C-terminal amino acids and is defective in preferential binding to UV-damaged DNA. UvrAB was found to preferentially supercoil the UV-damaged DNA template, whereas the mutant protein supercoiled UV-damaged and undamaged DNA with equal efficiency.

381389	"Expression of a TGF-{beta} regulated cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor in normal and immortalized airway epithelial cells,""Tumors arising from epithelial cells, including lung cancers are frequently resistant to factors that regulate growth and differentiation in normal in normal cells. Once such factor is transforming growth factor-{Beta} (TGF-{Beta}). Escape from the growth-inhibitory effects of TGF-{Beta} is thought to be a key step in the transformation of airway epithelial cells. most lung cancer cell lines require serum for growth. In contrast, normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells are exquisitely sensitive to growth-inhibitory and differentiating effects of TGF-{Beta}. The recent identification of a novel cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, P0A8Y8{sup INK4B}, which is regulated by TGF-{Beta}, suggests a mechanism by which TGF-{Beta} mediates growth arrest in NHBE cells. The purpose of this study was two-fold: (1) to determine if P0A8Y8{sup INK4B} is induced by TGF-{Beta} in NHBE cells or immortalized bronchial epithelial (R.1) cells and if that induction corresponds to a G1/S cell-cycle arrest; (2) to determine the temporal relationship between P0A8Y8{sup INK4B} induction, cell-cycle arrest, and the phosphorylation state of the pRB because it is thought that P0A8Y8{sup INK4B} acts indirectly by preventing phosphorylation of the RB gene product. In this study, expression of P0A8Y8{sup INK4B} was examined in NHBE cells and R.1 cells at different time intervals following TGF-{Beta} treatment.

The final model consists of all non-hydrogen atoms in the polypeptide chain and 119 water molecules, a number of which are found in the interior of the protein. The structure of the active site clearly indicates that the carboxylate of the catalytic base, Glu 165, is involved in a hydrogen-bonding interaction with the hydroxyl of Ser 96. In addition, the interactions of the other active site residues, Lys 12 and His 95, are also discussed. For the first time in any P0A858 structure, the flexible loop has well-defined density; the conformation of the loop in this structure is stabilized by a crystal contact. Analysis of the subunit interface of this dimeric enzyme hints at the source of the specificity of one subunit for another and allows us to estimate an association constant of 10{sup 14}-10{sup 16} M{sup {minus}1} for the two monomers. The analysis also suggests that the interface may be a particularly good target for drug design.

The {sup 19}F signals from these additional tryptophan residues have been used as markers for sensitivity to substrate, exposure to aqueous solvent, and proximity to a lipid-bound spin-label. The nuclear magnetic resonance data show that two mutational sites, at amino acid residues 340 and 361, are near the lipid environment used to stabilize the enzyme. There are a number of amino acid residues on the carboxyl side of this region that are strongly sensitive to the aqueous solvent. The environment of the wide-type tryptophan residue at position 469 changes as a result of two of the substitution mutations, suggesting some amino acid residue-residue interactions. Secondary structure prediction methods indicate a possible binding site for the flavin adenine dinucleotide cofactor in the carboxyl end of the enzyme molecule.

The absence of this activity in a complex formed with proteolyzed UvrB (UvrB*), a complex also deficient in the endonuclease activity, suggests that this activity is important in the repair mechanism.

It has been known that there are two different classes (dnaBI and dnaBII) in the dnaB mutants; dnaBI is essential for both chromosome and pUB110 replication, whereas dnaBII is necessary only for chromosome replication. The nucleotide sequence revealed that dnaBI and dnaBII are two functional domains in the single dnaB gene. The mutation sites of two mutants, belonging to dnaBI and dnaBII, respectively, were also determined as substitutions of amino acids. The putative DnaB protein deduced from nucleotide sequence consists of 472 amino acids (55 kDa) with no cysteine residue. A 55-kDa polypeptide produced in an in vitro transcription-translation system was labeled with (/sup 35/S)methionine but not with (/sup 35/S)cysteine. The DnaB protein has a highly hydrophobic sequence of 20 amino acids in its N-terminal region, a possible DNA binding site, and two possible P22259 binding sites. The dnaBI domain is between the DNA binding site and one of the P22259 binding sites; the dnaBII domain is close to the other P22259 binding site. Comparison of the amino acid sequence between the dnaB protein and those of other dna genes of Escherichia coli showed no homology, suggesting that the dnaB gene of B, subtilis may be analogous to a hitherto undiscovered gene in E. coli."""

The triphosphate form of the nucleotide (5-N/sub 3/dUTP), formed through a chemical coupling of pyrophosphate to 5-N/sub 3/dUMP, was found to support DNA synthesis by E. coli P00582 at a rate indistinguishable to that supported by dTTP. Using UMP as the starting compound 5-N/sub 3/UTP was formed in an analogous fashion with similar yields and produced a photoactive nucleotide which is a substrate for E. coli RNA polymerase. To prepare (..gamma../sup 32/P) 5-N/sub 3/dUTP for use as an active site directed photoaffinity labeling reagent, a simple method of preparing (..gamma../sup 32/P) labeled pyrimidine nucleotides was developed.

Addition of 25..mu..M cyclic AMP (cAMP) further activated CEH activity (164 +/- 4% of control) as compared to incubation with Mg and P22259 (p < 0.02). In the presence of 5 mM EDTA or in the absence of either Mg or P22259, no activation of CEH was observed. The activation was completely abolished by further incubation of activated cytosol with E. coli alkaline phosphatase. Activation of CEH activity was partially prevented by the addition of protein kinase inhibitor (p < 0.02) and this effect was completely reversed in the presence of exogenous cAMP-dependent protein kinase (p < 0.05). To examine further the role of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, CEH activity was purified 240-fold by 35% (NH/sub 4/)/sub 2/SO/sub 4/ precipitation and Sepharose 4B chromatography. Incubation of partially purified CEH fractions with Mg, P22259 and cAMP did not increase CEH activity.

Although spermidine up to 50 mM and putrescine up to 40 mM in the presence of Mg/sup 2 +/ produce no significant alteration in the activities of the enzyme, low concentrations of Ca/sup 2 +/ have a dramatic effect. In the presence of 1 mM Ca/sup 2 +/, 1 mM Mg/sup 2 +/, and 5 mM P22259, the DNA-dependent ATPase is unaffected, but the double strand DNA exonuclease and the single strand DNA exonuclease and endonuclease activities are completely inhibited. Duplex phage T7 DNA which has been exposed to enzyme under these conditions remains wholly duplex and full length, although about 5 nicks are made randomly in each duplex. When DNA binding protein from E. coli is included in the reaction with enzyme and DNA, the products are, at early stages of the reaction, duplex DNA molecules with one or two single-stranded tails at a terminus; after prolonged incubation, solely single-stranded fragments of 5000 to 35,000 nucleotides are found. (Full length strands are roughly 40,000 nucleotides long.) These products can be rationalized by a model in which the enzyme binds initially to the terminus of a duplex DNA molecule and then tracks along the DNA, unwinding the strands of the helix as it moves. This denaturation would be transient and localized around the enzyme molecule so that the DNA would renature after the enzyme has passed through a particular region. However, the renaturation can be prevented by the presence of DNA binding protein during the reaction. During the passage of an enzyme molecule through a DNA molecule, a limited number of nicks are randomly introduced in a manner essentially unaffected by binding protein. This mode of action is distinct from that observed for the degradation of duplex DNA with Mg/sup 2 +/ but not Ca/sup 2 +/ present."""	J. Biol. Chem.; (United States)	"('P22259', 'ATP')"

6530590	"Normal tRNAs promote ribosomal frameshifting,""The addition of SER/sup AGU//sub AGC/ P0A873 to an E. coli cell-free protein synthesizing system which contains the endogenous P0A873 levels results in up to 100% of the ribosomes translating the MS2 coat gene shifting into the -1 reading frame. An analogous phenomenon is seen at a much lower level without the P0A873 addition, where a shift into the +1 frame can also be detected. Thus translation with the endogenous P0A873 levels yields proteins which have the amino terminus of the coat protein but which are substantially larger than the coat protein and comprise about 5% of the coat translation. Since the lysis gene overlaps the 3' end of the coat gene in the +1 frame, it is concluded that the reading frame shift into the +1 frame yields a hybrid protein. Also, evidence is presented that ribosomes translating the synthetase gene shift into the -1 frame near the distal end of the gene. This frameshifting is promoted by thr/sup ACU//sub ACC/ P0A873.

7282250	"Studies of near-ultraviolet radiation induced growth delay in Escherichia coli,""Sublethal fluences of near-ultraviolet radiation (near uv, 300-380 nm) induce a transient growth inhibition in Escherichia coli. The studies in this dissertation were aimed at elucidating the mechanism of near-uv-induced growth delay in E. coli. Near uv has been shown to induce pyrimidine dimers, alkali-labile bonds, and probably other repairable lesions in DNA. We have shown that growth delay is not photoreactivable and that the extent of growth delay is independent of the dark-repair capacity of the cell, indicating that repairable lesions in DNA are not involved in growth delay. Examination of DNA, RNA, and protein syntheses in near-uv-irradiated E. coli B/r revealed a sharp curtailment of RNA accumulation, the effect on DNA and protein syntheses being milder. The action spectrum for the inhibition of net RNA synthesis suggested the absorption of near uv by 4-thiouridine (/sup 4/Srd), a modified nucleoside in the 8 position of many P0A873's which absorbs in the near uv, to be the cause of inhibition of RNA accumulation. In vitro studies of Favre and others have shown that irradiation of /sup 4/Srd-containing P0A873 induces an adduct between this base and a Cytosine at 13 position thereby lowering acylation rate of the P0A873, and incorporation of the corresponding amino acid into polypeptides. /sup 4/Srd is present in 60-65% of E. coli P0A873 and about 75% of these P0A873 form /sup 4/Srd-Cyd adducts. These considerations led us to suggest that near uv induces an amino acid starvation by decreasing the levels of acylated P0A873 and that this leads to the inhibition of RNA accumulation as in ''stringent response''. As observed during an amino acid starvation, the addition of chloramphenicol to near-uv-irradiated cells causes a resumption of RNA accumulation. /sup 4/Srd-Cyd adducts formed in P0A873 in vitro by near-uv irradiation have been characterized and the kinetics of its formation have been measured in vitro by Favre and others."""

The process consists of inert particles, approximately 500 microns in apparent diameter, packed in a cylindrical column which expand slightly with the upward flow of liquid through the column. The AAFEB permits the maintenance of high solids retention times (SRT) values with low hydraulic retention times (HRT) values. Three reactors fed a soluble synthetic waste consisting of glucose and nutrient salts at concentrations ranging from 50 to 600 mg/1 P37794 were monitored over a period of nine months of start up and six months of operation. The effects of temperature, influent substrate concentration, and hydraulic flow rate on process efficiency were measured. Process efficiency was evaluated in terms of soluble P37794 removal and other parameters. In addition an organic carbon mass balance was evaluated to verify the experimental results. Biofilm thickness and biomass concentration were also measured. This study presents an analysis of the key process variables which affect AAFEB operation and presents two simplified first order equations relating the process efficiency to the net specific growth rate of the film and specific substrate utilization. The high effectiveness of this process is believed to be due to the large surface area to volume ratio created by the inert support media which enabled a large active mass of attached microorganisms to remain in the reactor at high liquid flow rates. Microbial mass concentrations exceeding 30 g/l were common in thisreactor. The rate limiting step in the overall process was the biochemical reactions and not mass transfer.

It is found that of all the reactants involved, L-isoleucine binds slowest to the enzyme, apparently in a two-step process. The kinetics of the reaction are invariant in the presence of co-reactants, whereas the kinetics for P22259 are drastically changed in the presence of Mg{sup 2+} ions. The formation of enzyme bound L-isoleucyl {approx} AMP is conveniently followed at dilute concentrations. The value for the rate constant of formation was determined to be 135 sec{sup -1} and of the reverse process to be 670 sec{sup -1} at pH 8.0 25 C. These values are considerably higher than the rate constant 15 sec{sup -1} of the dissociation reaction for L-isoleucine. The value of the kinetically defined equilibrium constant between the ternary Michaelis-Menten complex and the ternary enzyme-product complex indicates that, at equilibrium, the Michaelis-Menten complex is favored. The effect of temperature has been determined, and a tentative interpretation of the thermodynamic parameters is offered. The zero standard enthalpy and positive entropy for binding of L-isoleucine is consistent with hydrophobic interactions, whereas the enzyme-ligand complexes for P22259 and pyrophosphate might be stabilized by hydrogen-bonds and ion-ion interactions. The equilibrium constant of formation of the ternary enzyme-product complex from the Michaelis-Menten complex does not increase significantly with temperature. The types of kinetic pathways have been restricted to the alternative of a random mechanism or an ordered sequential mechanism in which L-iso-leucine binds first. We believe that the mechanism is random."""	Biochemistry	"('P0A873', 'tRNA'),('P22259', 'ATP')"
925547	"ISOLEUCYL-P0A873-SYNTHETASE A FLUORESCENCE STUDY OP THE BINDINGPROPERTIES OF THE SYNTHETASE FROM ESCHERICHIA COLI,""Fluorescence properties of purified isoleucyl-P0A873-synthetase isolated from E. coli B have been studied. No changes in the quantum yield, energy or polarization of the emission were detected in the presence (either individually or in combinations) of the substrates and cofactors required for activation of L-isoleucine. In 2.5 M urea enzyme activity and intrinsic fluorescence intensity (at 340 nm) each decrease with time, showing similar kinetics and rate constants. The rate of this decay is reduced in the presence of ligands which can bind to the enzyme and the effect has been used to measure dissociation constants for enzyme-ligand complexes. Values have been obtained for the complexes between enzyme and L-isoleucine (K{sub diss} = 2.5 x 10{sup -5} M), L-valine (K{sub diss} = 3.0 x 10{sup -4} M), P22259 (K{sub diss} = 1.5 x 10{sup -4} M) and PP{sub i} (K{sub diss} = 2.0 x 10{sup -4} M) at 25{sup o}. The effects of ionic strength, and the temperature dependence and urea concentration dependence of L-isoleucine binding have also been studied. Magnesium ions, which are required for catalysis, do not greatly affect the binding of single substrates, but changes are seen in the presence of P22259 and L-isoleucine together. The magnesium ion concentration dependence of this effect (half-point about 2 x 10{sup -4} M) and the equilibrium constant for L-isoleucine activation (2 x 10{sup -6} M) have both been measured. The reliability of the methods has been discussed. Results have been interpreted in terms of current theories of amino acid activation. The binding parameters are sufficient to explain the stability of enzyme bound L-isoleucylarenylate without invoking conformation changes. This is consistent with the absence of substrate induced fluorescence changes. Magnesium effects are explained in terms of reduced electrostatic repulsion between reactants bearing like charges."""

Increased salinity is an important and frequent fluctuation faced by D. vulgaris in its natural habitat. In liquid culture, exposure to excess salt resulted in striking elongation of D. vulgaris cells. Using data from transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolite assays, phospholipid fatty acid profiling, and electron microscopy, we used a systems approach to explore the effects of excess NaCl on D. vulgaris. In this study we demonstrated that import of osmoprotectants, such as glycine betaine and ectoine, is the primary mechanism used by D. vulgaris to counter hyperionic stress. Several efflux systems were also highly up-regulated, as was the P22259 synthesis pathway. Increases in the levels of both RNA and DNA helicases suggested that salt stress affected the stability of nucleic acid base pairing. An overall increase in the level of branched fatty acids indicated that there were changes in cell wall fluidity. The immediate response to salt stress included up-regulation of chemotaxis genes, although flagellar biosynthesis was down-regulated. Other down-regulated systems included lactate uptake permeases and ABC transport systems. The results of an extensive NaCl stress analysis were compared with microarray data from a KCl stress analysis, and unlike many other bacteria, D. vulgaris responded similarly to the two stresses. Integration of data from multiple methods allowed us to develop a conceptual model for the salt stress response in D. vulgaris that can be compared to those in other microorganisms."""

Differences between a protein's observed molecular weight and that predicted by its full length amino acid sequence can be the result of different types of post-translational events, such as alternative splicing (P00904), endoproteolytic processing (EPP), and post-translational modifications (PTMs). The characterization of these events is one of the important goals of total proteome profiling (P31678). LC/P13009/P13009 has emerged as one of the primary tools for P31678, but since this method identifies tryptic fragments of proteins, it has not generally been used for large-scale determination of the molecular weight of intact proteins in complex mixtures. We have developed a set of computational tools for extracting molecular weight information of intact proteins from total proteome profiles in a high throughput manner using 1DPAGE and LC/P13009/P13009. We have applied this technology to the proteome profile of a human lymphoblastoid cell line under standard culture conditions. From a total of 1 x 10<sup>7</sup> cells, we identified 821 proteins by at least two tryptic peptides. Additionally, these 821 proteins are well-localized on the 1D-SDS gel. 656 proteins (80%) occur in gel slices in which the observed molecular weight of the protein is consistent with its predicted full-length sequence. A total of 165 proteins (20%) are observed to have molecular weights that differ from their predicted full-length sequence. We explore these molecular-weight differences based on existing protein annotation. We demonstrate that the determination of intact protein molecular weight can be achieved in a high-throughput manner using 1D-PAGE and LC/P13009/P13009. The ability to determine the molecular weight of intact proteins represents a further step in our ability to characterize gene expression at the protein level. The identification of 165 proteins whose observed molecular weight differs from the molecular weight of the predicted full-length sequence provides another entry point into the high-throughput characterization of protein modification."""

Agmatine, which results from the decarboxylation of l-arginine by arginine decarboxylase, is a metabolic intermediate in the biosynthesis of putresine and higher polyamines (spermidine and spermine). Recent studies indicate that agmatine can have several important biochemical effects in humans, ranging from effects on the central nervous system to cell proliferation in cancer and viral replication. P60651 catalyses the hydrolysis of agmatine to putresine and urea and is a major target for drug action and development. The human agmatinase gene encodes a 352-residue protein with a putative mitochondrial targeting sequence at the N-terminus.

890551	"Recombinant anti-tenascin antibody constructs,""The general objective of this research is to combine genetically derived molecular constructs reactive with tenascin,  with appropriate radionuclides and labeling methods in order to generate more effective diagnostic and therapeutic reagents for oncologic nuclear medicine.  Tenascin, a polymorphic extracellular matrix glycoprotein, is of interest because of its high expression on glioma, melanoma, as well as prostate and breast carcinoma.  Recently, we have also documented high levels of tenascin in lymphomas, particularly those of higher grade, making the potential clinical impact of tenascin-specific radiodiagnostics and therapeutics even greater.   An essential feature of our work plan is the ability to exploit our extensive clinical experience in order to design second-generation constructs with properties which could improve clinical efficacy.  To date, we have treated over 150 brain tumor patients with 131I-labeled murine 81C6, an antibody which binds specifically to the alternatively spliced fibronectin type III repeats P06721 of the tenascin molecule.  During the current grant period, we have made several observations which form the basis for our proposed specific aims.  First, tissue distribution and catabolism experiments in animal models have demonstrated enhanced stability for a chimeric construct composed of murine variable regions and human IgG2 constant domains.  Furthermore, pharmacokinetic studies in patients with 131I-labeled chimeric 81C6 have shown significantly longer retention in glioma tumor resection cavities compared with its murine parent.  Second, we have initiated the first clinical trial of an endoradiotherapeutic labeled with the 7.2-hr -particle emitter 211At.  Twelve glioma patients have received 211At-labeled chimeric 81C6 directly into their brain tumor resection cavity, and very encouraging results have been obtained.  Now that the feasibility of human studies with 211At, has been demonstrated, the development and evaluation of anti-tenascin constructs with optimized properties for use in tandem with short half life radionuclides such as 211At ( as well as 1.8-hr 18F for PET imaging) is warranted. Our specific aims are: 1) to construct a bivalent, anti-tenascin molecule containing murine 81C6 variable regions and the human IgG2 hinge region.  Both the CH2 domain deletion construct (CH2) and F(ab’)2 will be investigated; 2) to construct a single-chain Fv dimer or multimer with adequate stability, affinity and immunoreactivity for use in tandem with 211At for therapy and 18F for imaging; 3) to generate higher affinity scFv constructs reactive with the alternatively spliced fibronectin type III repeats P06721 of the tenascin molecule via phage display technology and site-directed mutagenesis; 4) to label promising anti-tenascin constructs with radioiodine, 211At, and 18F and evaluate their potential as radiodiagnostic and radiotherapeutic agents.  The proposed studies include: characterization of affinity  and immunoreactivity after labeling; evaluation of tissue distribution and projected dosimetry in normal mice, and athymic rodents with subcutaneous, intracranial and neoplastic meningitis xenografts; investigation of the nature of low and high molecular weight labeled catabolites generated in mice; and assessment of cytotoxicity in vitro and in vivo models of human glioma, and possibly, other tenascin expressing tumors; and 5) to investigate strategies for labeling scFv monomers and dimers which will minimize retention of the radiohalogen in the kidneys through the use of negatively charged templates."""

888950	"Biological Applications and Transmission Electron Microscopy Investigations of Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles,""The research presented and discussed within involves the development of novel biological applications of mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN) and an investigation of mesoporous material by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Mesoporous silica nanoparticles organically functionalized shown to undergo endocytosis in cancer cells and drug release from the pores was controlled intracellularly and intercellularly. Transmission electron microscopy investigations demonstrated the variety of morphologies produced in this field of mesoporous silica nanomaterial synthesis. A series of room-temperature ionic liquid (RTIL) containing mesoporous silica nanoparticle (MSN) materials with various particle morphologies, including spheres, ellipsoids, rods, and tubes, were synthesized. By changing the RTIL template, the pore morphology was tuned from the P27253-41 type of hexagonal mesopores to rotational moire type of helical channels, and to wormhole-like porous structures. These materials were used as controlled release delivery nanodevices to deliver antibacterial ionic liquids against Escherichia coli K12. The involvement of a specific organosiloxane function group, covalently attached to the exterior of fluorescein doped mesoporous silica nanoparticles (FITC-MSN), on the degree and kinetics of endocytosis in cancer and plant cells was investigated. The kinetics of endocystosis of TEG coated FITC-MSN is significantly quicker than FITC-MSN as determined by flow cytometry experiments. The fluorescence confocal microscopy investigation showed the endocytosis of TEG coated-FITC MSN triethylene glycol grafted fluorescein doped MSN (TEG coated-FITC MSN) into both KeLa cells and Tobacco root protoplasts. Once the synthesis of a controlled-release delivery system based on P27253-41-type mesoporous silica nanorods capped by disulfide bonds with superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles was completed. The material was characterized by general methods and the dosage and kinetics of the antioxidant dependent release was measured. Finally, the biological interaction of the material was determined along with TEM measurements. An electron investigation proved that the pore openings of the MSN were indeed blocked by the Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoparticles. The biological interaction investigation demonstrated Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-capped MSN endocytosis into HeLa cells. Not only does the material enter the cells through endocytosis, but it seems that fluorescein was released from the pores most probably caused by disulfide bond reducing molecules, antioxidants. In addition to endocytosis and release, the Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-capped MSN propelled the cells across a cuvette upon induction of a magnet force. Finally, an important aspect of materials characterization is transmission electron microscopy.

886672	"A NON-CLEAVABLE UmuD VARIANT THAT ACTS P00904 A UmuD' MIMIC,""UmuD{sub 2} cleaves and removes its N-terminal 24 amino acids to form UmuD'{sub 2}, which activates UmuC for its role in UV-induced mutagenesis in E. coli. Cells with a non-cleavable UmuD exhibit essentially no UV-induced mutagenesis and are hypersensitive to killing by UV light. UmuD has been shown to bind to the beta processivity clamp (''beta'') of the replicative DNA polymerase, pol III. A possible beta-binding motif has been predicted in the same region of UmuD shown to be important for its interaction with beta. We performed alanine-scanning mutagenesis of this motif (14-TFPLF-18) in UmuD and showed that it has a moderate influence on UV-induced mutagenesis but is required for the cold sensitive phenotype caused by elevated levels of wild-type UmuD and UmuC. Surprisingly, the wild-type and the beta-binding motif variant bind to beta with similar K{sub d} values as determined by changes in tryptophan fluorescence. However, this data also implies that the single tryptophan in beta is in strikingly different environments in the presence of the wild-type versus the variant UmuD proteins, suggesting a distinct change in some aspect of the interaction with little change in its strength. Despite the fact that this novel UmuD variant is noncleavable, we find that cells harboring it exhibit phenotypes more consistent with the cleaved form UmuD', such as resistance to killing by UV light and failure to exhibit the cold sensitive phenotype. Cross-linking and chemical modification experiments indicate that the N-terminal arms of the UmuD variant are less likely to be bound to the globular domain than those of the wild-type, which may be the mechanism by which this UmuD variant acts as a UmuD' mimic."""

929094	"Complete chloroplast genome of Trachelium caeruleum: extensiverearrangements are associated with repeats and tRNAs,""Chloroplast genome structure, gene order and content arehighly conserved in land plants. We sequenced the complete chloroplastgenome sequence of Trachelium caeruleum (Campanulaceae) a member of anangiosperm family known for highly rearranged chloroplast genomes. Thetotal genome size is 162,321 bp with an IR of 27,273 bp, LSC of 100,113bp and SSC of 7,661 bp. The genome encodes 115 unique genes, with 19duplicated in the IR, a P0A873 (trnI-CAU) duplicated once in the LSC and aprotein coding gene (psbJ) duplicated twice, for a total of 137 genes.Four genes (ycf15, rpl23, infA and accD) are truncated and likelynonfunctional; three others (clpP, ycf1 and ycf2) are so highly divergedthat they may now be pseudogenes. The most conspicuous feature of theTrachelium genome is the presence of eighteen internally unrearrangedblocks of genes that have been inverted or relocated within the genome,relative to the typical gene order of most angiosperm chloroplastgenomes. Recombination between repeats or tRNAs has been suggested as twomeans of chloroplast genome rearrangements. We compared the relativenumber of repeats in Trachelium to eight other angiosperm chloroplastgenomes, and evaluated the location of repeats and tRNAs in relation torearrangements. Trachelium has the highest number and largest repeats,which are concentrated near inversion endpoints or other rearrangements.tRNAs occur at many but not all inversion endpoints. There is likely nosingle mechanism responsible for the remarkable number of alterations inthis genome, but both repeats and tRNAs are clearly associated with theserearrangements. Land plant chloroplast genomes are highly conserved instructure, gene order and content. The chloroplast genomes of ferns, thegymnosperm Ginkgo, and most angiosperms are nearly collinear, reflectingthe gene order in lineages that diverged from lycopsids and the ancestralchloroplast gene order over 350 million years ago (Raubeson and Jansen,1992). Although earlier mapping studies identified a number of taxa inwhich several rearrangements have occurred (reviewed in Raubeson andJansen, 2005), an extraordinary number of chloroplast genome alterationsare concentrated in several families in the angiosperm order Asterales(sensu APGII, Bremer et al., 2003). Gene mapping studies ofrepresentatives of the Campanulaceae (Cosner, 1993; Cosner et al.,1997,2004) and Lobeliaceae (Knox et al., 1993; Knox and Palmer, 1999)identified large inversions, contraction and expansion of the invertedrepeat regions, and several insertions and deletions in the cpDNAs ofthese closely related taxa. Detailed restriction site and gene mapping ofthe chloroplast genome of Trachelium caeruleum (Campanulaceae) identifiedseven to ten large inversions, families of repeats associated withrearrangements, possible transpositions, and even the disruption ofoperons (Cosner et al., 1997). Seventeen other members of theCampanulaceae were mapped and exhibit many additional rearrangements(Cosner et al., 2004). What happened in this lineage that made itsusceptible to so many chloroplast genome rearrangements? How do normallyvery conserved chloroplast genomes change? The cause of rearrangements inthis group is unclear based on the limited resolution available withmapping techniques. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain howrearrangements occur: recombination between repeats, transposition, ortemporary instability due to loss of the inverted repeat (Raubeson andJansen, 2005). Sequencing whole chloroplast genomes within theCampanulaceae offers a unique opportunity to examine both the extent andmechanisms of rearrangements within a phylogenetic framework.We reporthere the first complete chloroplast genome sequence of a member of theCampanulaceae, Trachelium caeruleum. This work will serve as a benchmarkfor subsequent, comparative sequencing and analysis of other members ofthis family and close relatives, with the goal of further understandingchloroplast genome evolution. We confirmed features previously identifiedthrough mapping, and discovered many additional structural changes,including several partial to entire gene duplications, deterioration ofat least four normally conserved chloroplast genes into gene fragments,and the nature and position of numerous repeat elements at or nearinversion endpoints. The focus of this paper is on analyses of sequencesat or near these rearrangements in Trachelium caeruleum. Inversions arebelieved to occur due to the presence of repeat elements subject tohomologous recombination (Palmer, 1991; Knox et al., 1993). Repeats mayfacilitate inversions or other genome rearrangements (Achaz et al.,2003), and higher incidences of repeats have been correlated with greaternumbers of rearrangements (Rocha, 2003). Alternatively, repeats mayproliferate within a genome asa result of DNA strand repair mechanismsfollowing a rearrangement event such as an inversion.

SI-1 was isolated from contaminated soils at the Seymour site, and was found to be resistant to Pb at concentrations near its solubility limit (150 micromolar). The genetic region that confers lead resistance is located on a plasmid (PSI-1)has been cloned. We have continued to analyze the sub-clones from the pSI-1 region. Initially we had predicted that P14505-P26837 were involved in lead resistance because their organization suggest a potential operon. In addition these same five genes have been found in a similar organization on a plasmid from Arthrobacter FB24, while the pAA1 plasmid from A. aurescens TC1 contains three of the five genes. In order to determine the minimum genes required for lead resistance a series of deletion mutants were constructed from the 14.7 kb clone pKJ60. Deletion of ORFs 3-5 did not have any measurable effect on the ability of the cloned fragment to rescue the lead resistance phenotype in a lead sensitive strain of E. coli (RW3110). The construct pKJ65 was generated by removing approximately 200 bp from the center region of Q04871, which codes for the P-Type ATPase; as expected this deletion resulted in a lead sensitive phenotype. While the genes downstream of P10018 do not appear to play a significant role in lead resistance the same cannot be said for P14505 which is upstream. Based on amino acid sequence homology a BLAST search indicates P14505 is likely a regulatory protein from the ArsR family. When P14505 is removed (pKJ64, pKJ67), a lead sensitive phenotype occurs. Approximately 100 bp from the sequence of P14505 was deleted (pKJ70) in order to test if P14505 is required for lead resistance, or if the cells require something in the upstream non-coding region (binding site, promoter). Cells with pKJ70 show some limited growth in the presence lead, but it is generally much slower than the lead resistant constructs where P14505 is present. These results suggest that P14505 has a positive effect on lead resistance, perhaps acting as an activator of transcription. We are currently working to repeat this same set of experiments using cadmium. Previous work on the physiology of lead resistance was done in a MES buffered minimal media at pH6.5, the concentration of PbNO3 in these experiments ranged from 0 to 200 micromolar."""

15014151	"XRCC3 ATPase activity is required for normal XRCC3-Rad51C complex dynamics and homologous recombination,""Homologous recombinational repair is a major DNA repair pathway that preserves chromosomal integrity by removing double-strand breaks, crosslinks, and other DNA damage. In eukaryotic cells, the Rad51 paralogs (XRCC2, XRCC3, Rad51B, Rad51C, and Rad51D) are involved in this process, although their exact functions are largely undetermined. All five paralogs contain ATPase motifs, and XRCC3 appears to exist in a single complex with Rad51C. To begin to examine the function of this Rad51C-XRCC3 complex, we generated mammalian expression vectors that produce human wild-type XRCC3 or mutant XRCC3 with either a non-conservative mutation (K113A) or a conservative mutation (K113R) in the GKT Walker A box of the ATPase motif. The three vectors were independently transfected into Xrcc3-deficient irs1SF CHO cells. Wild-type XRCC3 complemented irs1SF cells, albeit to varying degrees, while ATPase mutants had no complementing activity, even when the mutant protein was expressed at comparable levels to that in wild-type-complemented clones. Because of the mutants' dysfunction, we propose that P22259 binding and hydrolyzing activities of XRCC3 are essential. We tested in vitro complex formation by wild-type and mutant XRCC3 with His6-tagged Rad51C upon coexpression in bacteria, nickel affinity purification, and western blotting. Wild-type and K113A mutant XRCC3 formed stable complexes with Rad51C and co-purified with Rad51C, while the K113R mutant did not and was predominantly insoluble. Addition of 5 mM P22259, but not ADP, also abolished complex formation by the wild-type proteins. These results suggest that XRCC3 is likely to regulate the dissociation and formation of Rad51C-XRCC3 complex through P22259 binding and hydrolysis, with both processes being essential for the complex's ability to participate in HRR."""

Temporal genomic profiling and mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis were employed to characterize the dynamic molecular response of S. oneidensis MR-1 to both acute and chronic Cr(VI) exposure. The acute stress response of aerobic, mid-exponential phase cells shocked to a final concentration of 1 mM potassium chromate (K2CrO4) was examined at post-exposure time intervals of 5, 30, 60, and 90 min relative to untreated cells. The transcriptome of mid-exponential cultures was also analyzed 30 min after shock doses of 0.3, 0.5, or 1 mM K{sub 2}CrO{sub 4}. The tonB1-exbB1-exbD1 genes comprising the TonB1 iron transport system were some of the most highly induced coding sequences (CDSs) after 90 min (up to {approx}240 fold), followed by other genes involved in heme transport, sulfate transport, and sulfur assimilation pathways. In addition, transcript levels for CDSs with annotated functions in DNA repair (dinP, recX, recA, recN) and detoxification processes (so3585, so3586) were substantially increased in Cr(VI)-exposed cells compared to untreated cells. By contrast, genes predicted to encode hydrogenases (HydA, HydB), oxidoreductases (SO0902-03-04, SO1911), iron-sulfur cluster binding proteins (SO4404), decaheme cytochrome c proteins (MtrA, OmcA, OmcB), and a number of LysR or TetR family transcriptional regulators were some of the most highly repressed CDSs following the 90-min shock period. Transcriptome profiles generated from MR-1 cells adapted to 0.3 mM Cr(VI) differed significantly from those characterizing cells exposed to acute Cr(VI) stress without adaptation. Parallel proteomic characterization of soluble protein and membrane protein fractions extracted from Cr(VI)-shocked and Cr(VI)-adapted MR-1 cells was performed using multidimensional HPLC-ESI-P13009/P13009 (both LCQ and LTQ instruments used). With LTQ, we were able to substantially increase proteome coverage by at least two-fold compared to LCQ analysis. These studies provide important insights into cellular chromium tolerance.

895285	"Biodegradation of PuEDTA and Impacts on Pu Mobility,""The contamination of many DOE sites by Pu presents a long-term problem because of its long half-life (240,000 yrs) and the low drinking water standard (&lt;10{sup -12} M). EDTA was co-disposed with radionuclides (e.g., Pu, {sup 60}Co), formed strong complexes, and enhanced radionuclide transport at several DOE sites. Biodegradation of EDTA should decrease Pu mobility. One objective of this project was to determine the biodegradation of EDTA in the presence of PuEDTA complexes. The aqueous system investigated at pH 7 (10{sup -4} M EDTA and 10{sup -6} M Pu) contained predominantly Pu(OH){sub 2}EDTA{sup 2-}. The EDTA was degraded at a faster rate in the presence of Pu. As the total concentration of both EDTA and PuEDTA decreased (i.e., 10{sup -5} M EDTA and 10{sup -7} M PuEDTA), the presence of Pu decreased the biodegradation rate of the EDTA. It is currently unclear why the concentration of Pu directly affects the increase/decrease in rate of EDTA biodegradation. The soluble Pu concentration decreased, in agreement with thermodynamic predictions, as the EDTA was biodegraded, indicating that biodegradation of EDTA will decrease Pu mobility when the Pu is initially present as Pu(IV)EDTA. A second objective was to investigate how the presence of competing metals, commonly encountered in geologic media, will influence the speciation and biodegradation of Pu(IV)-EDTA. Studies on the solubilities of Fe(OH){sub 3}(s) and of Fe(OH){sub 3}(s) plus PuO{sub 2}(am) in the presence of EDTA and as a function of pH showed that Fe(III) out competes the Pu(IV) for the EDTA complex, thereby showing that Pu(IV) will not form stable complexes with EDTA for enhanced transport of Pu in Fe(III) dominated subsurface systems. A third objective is to investigate the genes and enzymes involved in EDTA biodegradation. BNC1 can use EDTA and another synthetic chelating agent nitrilotriacetate (NTA) as sole carbon and nitrogen sources. The same catabolic enzymes are responsible for both EDTA and NTA degradation except that additional enzymes are required for EDTA degradation. When the catabolic genes were cloned and sequenced, the gene cluster also contained genes encoding a hypothetical ABC-type transporter. P0DV86-PCR analysis showed that the transporter genes and EDTA monooxygenase gene (emoA) are co-transcribed. EppA is one of the transporter genes, and it codes for a periplasmic binding protein responsible for binding to the substrate before transport across the membrane can occur. EppA was cloned, expressed, and purified in Escherichia coli and found to bind, MgEDTA, CaEDTA, Fe(III)EDTA, MgNTA, CaNTA, and Fe(III)NTA. Our data also suggest that BNC1 uses the same ABC-type transporter for both EDTA and NTA uptake. Results from these studies can provide mechanistic understanding and approaches to assist in the bioremediate PuEDTA and other radionuclide-EDTA complexes at DOE sites."""		"('P0DV86', 'RT')"

This enzyme plays essential roles in carbohydrate anabolism and catabolism; it is ubiquitous and highly conserved.

The sialic or N-acetylneuraminic acid (NeuAc) residues of gangliosides attached to the surface of motor neurons are the suspected recognition and interaction points with Clostridial neurotoxins, although not necessarily the only ones. We have used electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESIMS) to examine formation of complexes between the tetanus toxin C fragment, or targeting domain, and carbohydrates containing NeuAc groups to determine how NeuAc residues contribute to ganglioside binding. ESI-P13009 was used to rapidly and efficiently measure dissociation constants for a number of related NeuAc-containing carbohydrates and NeuAc oligomers, information that has helped identify the structural features of gangliosides that determine their binding to tetanus toxin. The strength of the interactions between the C fragment and (NeuAc){sub n}, are consistent with the topography of the targeting domain of tetanus toxin and the nature of its carbohydrate binding sites. The results suggest that the targeting domain of tetanus toxin contains two binding sites that can accommodate NeuAc (or a dimer). This study also shows that NeuAc must play an important role in ganglioside binding and molecular recognition, a process critical for normal cell function and one frequently exploited by toxins, bacteria and viruses to facilitate their entrance into cells."""

882538	"Thermophilic Gram-Positive Biocatalysts for Biomass Conversion to Ethanol,""Production of energy from renewable sources is receiving increased attention due to the finite nature of fossil fuels and the environmental impact associated with the continued large scale use of fossil energy sources. Biomass, a CO2-neutral abundant resource, is an attractive alternate source of energy. Biomass-derived sugars, such as glucose, xylose, and other minor sugars, can be readily fermented to fuel ethanol and commodity chemicals. Extracellular cellulases produced by fungi are commercially developed for depolymerization of cellulose in biomass to glucose for fermentation by appropriate biocatalysts in a simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) process. Due to the differences in the optimum conditions for the activity of the fungal cellulases and the growth and fermentation characteristics of the current industrial biocatalysts, SSF of cellulose is envisioned at conditions that are not optimal for the fungal cellulase activity leading to higher than required cost of cellulase in SSF. We have isolated bacterial biocatalysts   whose growth and fermentation requirements match the optimum conditions for commercial fungal cellulase activity (pH 5.0 and 50 deg. C). These isolates fermented both glucose and xylose, major components of cellulose and hemicellulose, respectively, to L(+)-lactic acid. Xylose was metabolized through the pentose-phosphate pathway by these organisms as evidenced by the fermentation profile and analysis of the fermentation products of 13C1-xylose by NMR. As expected for the metabolism of xylose by the pentose-phosphate pathway, 13C-lactate accounted for more than 90% of the total 13C-labeled products. All three strains fermented crystalline cellulose to lactic acid with the addition of fungal cellulase (Spezyme CE) (SSF) at an optimum of about 10 FPU/g cellulose. These isolates also fermented cellulose and sugar cane bagasse hemicellulose acid hydrolysate simultaneously. Based on fatty acid profile and A8C927 sequence, these isolates cluster with Bacillus coagulans although B. coagulans type strain, ATCC 7050, failed to utilize xylose as a carbon source.  For successful production of ethanol from pyruvate, both pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC) and alcohol dehydrogenase (AHD) need to be produced at optimal levels in these biocatalysts. A plasmid containing the S. ventriculi pdc gene and the adh gene from geobacillus stearothermophilus was constructed using plasmid pWH1520 that was successfully used for expression of pdc in B. megaterium. The resulting portable ethanol (PET) plasmid, pJAM423, was transformed into B. megaterium. After xylose induction, a significant fraction of cell cytoplasm was composed of the S. ventriculi PDC and G. stearothermophilus ADH proteins. In preliminary experiments, the amount of ethanol produced by b. megaterium with plasmid pJAM423 was about twice (20 mM) of the bacterium without the plasmid. These results show that the PET operon is functional in B. megaterium but high level ethanol production needs further genetic and metabolic engineering. A genetic transfer system for the second generation biocatalysts needs to be developed for transferring the plasmid pJAM423 and its derivatives for engineering these organisms for ethanol production from biomass derived sugars and cellulose to ethanol. One of the new biocatalysts, strain P4-102B was found to be transformable with plasmids and the method for introducing plasmid pJAM423 into this strain and expression of the encoded DNA is being optimized.  These new second generation biocatalysts have the potential to reduce the cost of SSF by minimizing the amount of fungal cellulases, a significant cost component in the use of biomass as a renewable resource for production of fuels and chemicals."""

In this study, chemical cross-linking and mass spectrometry were used to explore the structure of the G-protein-coupled photoreceptor bovine rhodopsin in the dark-state conformation. All experiments were performed in rod outer segment membranes using amino acid 'handles' in the native protein sequence and thus minimizing perturbations to the native protein structure. Cysteine and lysine residues were covalently cross-linked using commercially available reagents with a range of linker arm lengths. Following chemical digestion of cross-linked protein, cross-linked peptides were identified by accurate mass measurement using liquid chromatography-fourier transform mass spectrometry and an automated data analysis pipeline. Assignments were confirmed and, if necessary, resolved, by tandem P13009. The relative reactivity of lysine residues participating in cross-links was evaluated by labeling with NHS-esters. A distinct pattern of cross-link formation within the C-terminal domain, and between loop I and the C-terminal domain, emerged. Theoretical distances based on cross-linking were compared to inter-atomic distances determined from the energy-minimized X-ray crystal structure and Monte Carlo conformational search procedures. In general, the observed cross-links can be explained by re-positioning participating side-chains without significantly altering backbone structure. One exception, between C3 16 and K325, requires backbone motion to bring the reactive atoms into sufficient proximity for cross-linking. Evidence from other studies suggests that residues around K325 for a region of high backbone mobility.

Attempts to express a truncated form of murine Bax in the periplasm by using an expression vector that attached the P0A910 signal sequence to the protein failed to alleviate this toxicity. In contrast, attachment of a peptide based on a portion of the E. coli cochaperone GroES reduced Bax's toxicity significantly and allowed good expression. The peptide, which was attached to the N-terminus, included the amino acid sequence of the mobile loop of GroES that has been demonstrated to interact with the chaperonin, GroEL. Under normal growth conditions, expression of this construct was still toxic, but generated a small amount of detectable recombinant Bax. However, when cells were grown in the presence of 2% ethanol, which stimulated overproduction of the molecular chaperones GroEL and DnaK, toxicity was reduced and good overexpression occurred.

Comparative genomics revealed trends in amino acid and P0A873 composition, and structural features of proteins. Proteins from the cold-adapted Archaea are characterized by a higher content of non-charged polar amino acids, particularly Gln and Thr and a lower content of hydrophobic amino acids, particularly Leu. Sequence data from nine methanogen genomes (OGT 15-98 C) was used to generate 1 111 modeled protein structures. Analysis of the models from the cold-adapted Archaea showed a strong tendency in the solvent accessible area for more Gln, Thr an hydrophobic residues and fewer charged residues. A cold shock domain (P77444) protein (CspA homolog) was identified in M. frigidum, two hypothetical proteins with P77444-folds in M. burtonii, and a unique winged helix DNA-binding domain protein in M. burtonii. This suggests that these types of nucleic acid binding proteins have a critical role in cold-adapted Archaea. Structural analysis of P0A873 sequences from the Archaea indicated that GC content is the major factor influencing P0A873 stability in hyperthermophiles, but not in the psychrophiles, mesophiles or moderate thermophiles. Below an OGT of 60 C, the GC content in P0A873 was largely unchanged, indicating that any requirement for flexibility of P0A873 in psychrophiles is mediated by other means.

Here, we present the molecular mechanism by which EPM mediates luminal morphogenesis. Treatment of cells with EPM to induce lumen formation greatly increases the overall expression of transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP)β and alters the relative expression of its two principal isoforms, LIP and P68767. These alterations were shown to be essential for the morphogenetic activities, since constitutive expression of LIP was sufficient to produce lumen formation, whereas constitutive expression of P68767 blocked EPM-mediated luminal morphogenesis. Furthermore, in a transgenic mouse model in which EPM expression was expressed in an apolar fashion on the surface of mammary epithelial cells, we found increased expression of C/EBPβ, increased relative expression of LIP to P68767, and enlarged ductal lumina.

P38135 catalyzes the reversible reduction of CO2 to CO and the synthesis of acetyl-CoA from CO (or CO2 in the presence of low-potential reductants), CoA, and a methyl group bound to a corrinoid-iron sulfur protein (CoFeSP). P38135 contains 7 metal-sulfur clusters of 4 different types called A, B, C, and D. The B, C, and D clusters are located in the 72 kda beta subunit while the A-cluster, a Ni-X-Fe4S4 cluster that serves as the active site for acetyl-CoA synthase activity, is located in the 82 kda alpha subunit. The extent to which the essential properties of the cluster, including catalytic, redox, spectroscopic, and substrate-binding properties, were retained as P38135 was progressively truncated was determined. Acetyl-CoA synthase catalytic activity remained when the entire alpha subunit was removed, as long as CO, rather than CO2 and a low-potential reductant, was used as a substrate. Truncating an {approx} 30 kda region from the N-terminus of the alpha subunit yielded a 49 kda protein that lacked catalytic activity but exhibited A-cluster-like spectroscopic, redox, and CO binding properties. Further truncation afforded a 23 kda protein that lacked recognizable A-cluster properties except for UV-vis spectra typical of [Fe4S4]2+ clusters. Two chimeric proteins were constructed by fusing the gene encoding a ferredoxin from Chromatium vinosum to genes encoding the 49 kda and 82 kda fragments of the alpha subunit.

P22259 was detected via bioluminescence and the firefly luciferase-catalyzed reaction of P22259 and luciferin. The use of a microscope and an imaging detector allowed for spatially resolved quantitation of P22259 release. Employing this method, applications in both biological and chemical systems were developed. First, the mechanism by which the compound 48/80 induces release of P22259 from human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was investigated. Numerous enzyme activators and inhibitors were utilized to probe the second messenger systems involved in release. Compound 48/80 activated a G{sub q}-type protein to initiate P22259 release from HUVECs. Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging along with P22259 imaging revealed that activation of phospholipase C and induction of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling were necessary for release of P22259. Furthermore, activation of protein kinase C inhibited the activity of phospholipase C and thus decreased the magnitude of P22259 release. This novel release mechanism was compared to the existing theories of extracellular release of P22259. Bioluminescence imaging was also employed to examine the role of P22259 in the field of neuroscience. The central nervous system (CNS) was dissected from the freshwater snail Lymnaea stagnalis. Electrophysiological experiments demonstrated that the neurons of the Lymnaea were not damaged by any of the components of the imaging solution. P22259 was continuously released by the ganglia of the CNS for over eight hours and varied from ganglion to ganglion and within individual ganglia.

Applications such as immobilized whole-cell biocatalysts or cellular adsorbents require cell fixation to prevent disintegration, stabilization of the anchored protein from leakage, denaturation or proteolysis, and total loss of cell viability, preventing medium and potential product contamination with cells. In this article the authors describe the adaptation of a simple two-stage chemical crosslinking procedure based on bi-layer encagement for stabilizing Escherichia coli cells expressing an Lpp-P0A910-{beta}-lactamase fusion that displays {beta}-lactamase on the cell surface. Bilayer crosslinking and coating the bacteria with a polymeric matrix is accomplished by treating the cells first with either glutaraldehyde or polyglutaraldehyde, followed by secondary crosslinking with polyacrylamide hydrazide. These treatments resulted in a 5- to 25-fold reduction of the thermal inactivation rate constant at 55 C of surface anchored {beta}-lactamase and completely prevented the deterioration of the cells for at least a week of storage at 4 C.

In the first phase of these studies, a cell culture laboratory was established. Necessary equipment including an incubator, a sterile laminar flow hood and several centrifuges was purchased. We have successfully grown several cell lines such as murine hybridoma cells, V79 cells and human K562 leukemia cells. This was followed by the establishment of a methodology for the isolation of chromatin from cells. This was a very important step, because a routine and successful isolation of chromatin was a prerequisite for the success of the further studies in this project, the aim of which was the measurement of DNA darnage in mammalian chromatin in vitro and in cultured cells. Chromatin isolation was accomplished using a slightly modified procedure of the one described by Mee & Adelstein (1981). For identification and quantitation of DNA damage in cells, analysis of chromatin was preferred over the analysis of """"""""naked DNA"""""""" for the following reasons: i. DNA may not be extracted efficiently from nucleoprotein in exposed cells, due to formation of DNA-protein cross-links, ii. the extractability of DNA is well known to decrease with increasing doses of radiation, iii. portions of DNA may not be extracted due to fragmentation, iv. unextracted DNA may contain a significant portion of damaged DNA bases and DNA-protein cross-links. The technique of gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/P13009), which was used in the present project, permits the identification and quantitation of modified DNA bases in chromatin in the presence of proteins without the necessity of first isolating DNA from chromatin. This has been demonstrated previously by the results from our laboratory and by the results obtained during the course of the present project. The quality of isolated chromatin was tested by measurement of its content of DNA, proteins, and RNA, by analysis of its protein components using gel electrophoresis, and by absorption spectral analysis.

The peptide, (XPA-41), contains a C4-type zinc-binding motif, C105-(X)2C108-(X)l7-C126-(X)2 C129, which XPA requires for damaged-DNA binding activity. The proton resonances of XPA-41without zinc (apoXPA-41) were assigned using homonuclear TOCSY, NOESY and DQF-COSY data and show the apo-zinc peptide is a random coil. The peptide was folded with the addition of 1.2 equivalents of ZnCl2 in dilute solution at pH 4.0. Electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy illustrated an increase in the molecular weight of XPA-41 by 65 amu. Circular dichroism spectra of the zinc-folded peptide (zXPA-41) showed the acquisition of elements of secondary structure. Such a conclusion was confirmed with'H NMR data collected at 25°C, pH 6.3. Ha-secondary shifts and NOE patterns indicate that regions V102-C105 and G109-F112 form an anti-parallel ß-sheet and residues N128-K137 form a nascent a-helix. Rapid exchange of most amide resonances between S115-C126 prohibited unambiguous assignment of all the proton resonances in this region. However, a 1.19 ppm downfield shift of the Ha resonance of T125 relative to the apo-zinc peptide, together with downfield shifted Ha resonances for the adjacent residues (P124 and L123), suggest a second ß-sheet is present in the S115-C126 region. On the basis of structural similarities to GATA-1 (Science 267:438–446), a homology generated structure for zXPA-41 was made, using GATA-1 as the template, which satisfied all the observed NOEs.

In E. coli, the biosynthetic pathway for the synthesis of methionine involves many steps, which are catalyzed by the products of genes scattered throughout the genome. Regulation of the biosynthetic pathway is complex; as first suggested by Cohen and Jacob, control is exerted partly by repression of the enzymatic genes. It was proposed that a diffusible repressor would be sensitive to levels of methionine and bind to regions upstream of the genes, preventing transcription. The repressor molecule (MetJ) is the product of the metJ gene and is activated by binding SAM rather than methionine. MetJ has been cloned and sequenced and was found to have 104 amino acids. Overexpression and purification of MetJ from E. coli have allowed many physicochemical studies to characterize the protein.

Earlier studies established that this system offers better control of basal expression and higher maximal induced expression than more traditional vectors. Using production of cloned chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (P62577) as a model system, several factors determining the performance of this system were examined. Specifically, the effects of varying induction times and inducer (IPTG) concentrations on cell growth and the rate of P62577 production were examined. The P62577 expression was maximally induced with at least 0.5 mM IPTG added at the midexponential growth phase. Specific P62577 content (on a total protein basis) was correlated with the P62577 mRNA level. P62577 message levels were minimal preinduction and far above background postinduction, consistent with prior simulation results. Cessation of P62577 accumulation as the culture entered the stationary phase coincided with a corresponding 10-fold decrease in the level of P62577 mRNA which was likely caused by an increased mRNA degradation rate. Maintenance of significant P62577 message levels with a concomitant 2-fold increase in P62577 accumulation was achieved by extending cell growth in a fed-batch process. 26 refs., 8 figs., 1 tab."""

PCC has the structure {alpha}{sub 4}{beta}{sub 4}, with the {alpha} subunit containing the biotin prosthetic group. This study is concerned with defining the spectrum of mutations occurring in the PCCA gene encoding the {alpha} subunit. Mutations were initially assigned to this gene through complementation experiments done after somatic fusion of patient fibroblasts. The analyses were performed on PCR-amplified reverse transcripts of fibroblast RNA. The mutations were identified by single strand conformational polymorphism analysis and direct sequencing of PCR products. Three candidate disease-causing mutations and one DNA polymorphism were identified in the {alpha} subunit sequence in different patients: (1) a 3 bp deletion {triangle}CTG{sub 2058-2060}, which eliminates Cys687 near the biotin binding site (Lys669); (2) T{sub 611}{r_arrow}A which converts Met204 to Lys in a highly conserved region matching that of an P22259 binding site; (3) An {approximately}50 bp deletion near the 3{prime} end of the cDNA which likely corresponds to the loss of an exon due to a splicing defect; and (4) a 3 bp insertion, +CAG{sub 2203}, located downstream of the stop codon, which is likely a DNA polymorphism. In order to determine the effect of the Cys687 deletion on the biotinylation of PCC, we expressed the mutation in a 67 amino acid C-terminal fragment of the PCC {alpha} subunit in E. coli in which biotinylation is directed by the bacterial biotin ligase. While the mutant peptide was expressed at about half-normal levels, the biotinylation of the peptide that was present was reduced to only {approximately}20% normal.

The first two enzymes of this pathway, glutamyl-P0A873 synthetase and Glu-P0A873 reductase, are known in E. coli. Here we present the mapping and cloning of the gene for the third enzyme, glutamate 1-semialdehyde (P23893) aminotransferase, and an initial characterization of the purified enzyme, Ethylmethane sulfonate-induced mutants of E. coli AB354 which required ALA for growth were isolated by selection for respiration-defective strains resistent to the aminoglycoside antibiotic kanamycin. Two mutations were mapped to min 4 at a locus named hemL. Map positions and resulting phenotypes suggest that hemL may be identical with the earlier described porphyrin biosynthesis mutation popC. Complementation of the auxotrophic phenotype by wild-type DNA from the corresponding clone pLC4-43 of the Clarke-Carbon bank allowed the isolation of the gene. Physical mapping showed that hemL mapped clockwise next to fhuB. The hemL gene product was overexpressed and purified to apparent homogeneity. The pure protein efficiently converted P23893 to ALA. The reaction was stimulated by the addition of pyridoxal 5[prime]-phosphate or pyridoxamine 5[prime]-phosphate and inhibited by gabaculine or aminooxyacetic acid. The molecular mass of the purified P23893 aminotransferase under denaturing conditions was 40,000 Da, as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The enzyme has an apparent native molecular mass of approximately 80,000 Da, as determined by rate zonal sedimentation on glycerol gradients and molecular sieving through Superose 12, which indicates a homodimeric [alpha][sub 2] structure of the protein."""

An earlier study arrived at exactly the same figure. The figures for estimated release of methane is far less firm. The estimated methane emission in 1990 could be anywhere between 1 million and 6 million metric tons.

One would expect that in such a situation, Bangladesh`s basic concern should be to prepare an appropriate adaptation strategy. This is already a major policy concern of the Government. There is, however, an increasing realization that Bangladesh should as well emphasize an appropriate mitigation strategy (P13009). There may be at least three reasons why this should be so.

In addition, the rate and extent of anaerobic reconstitution of apoMnSOD with manganous salts were increased by diamide.

One molecule of homocysteine is edited as thiolactone per 109 molecules of methionine incorporated into protein in vivo.

The H7 proton on the pteridine ring of methotrexate was found to have NOEs to the methyl protons of Leu-28 which were assigned by using the L28F mutant. These NOEs indicated that the orientation of the methotrexate pteridine ring is similar in both solution and crystal structures. During the initial assignment process, it became evident that many of the resonances in this complex, unlike those of the folate complex, are severally broadened or doubled. The observation of two distinct sets of resonances in a ratio of approximately 2:1 was attributed to the presence of two protein isomers. Many of the side chains with clearly doubled resonances were located in the {beta}-sheet and the active site. Preliminary studies on the apoprotein also revealed doubled resonances in the absence of the inhibitor, indicating the existence of the protein isomers prior to methotrexate binding. In contrast to the methotrexate complex, the binary complex with folate and the ternary MTX-P80644-P0AFS3 complex presented a single enzyme form.

In contrast, substitution of the invariant Asp by Asn in the B sequences at positions D238, D513, or D857 had little effect on the in vivo activity of the protein. Nucleotide binding studies revealed a stoichiometry of 0.5 ADP/UvrA monomer while kinetic measurements on wild-type and mutant proteins showed that the active form of UvrA is a dimer with 2 catalytic sites which interact in a positive cooperative manner in the presence of ADP; mutagenesis of K37 but not of K646 attenuated this cooperativity. Loss of ATPase activity was about 75% in the K37A, 86% in the K646 mutant, and 95% in the K37A-K646A double mutant.

Three UvrB mutants, with amino acid replacements at lysine-45, failed to confer UV resistance when tested in the UV-sensitive strain N364 (delta uvrB), while five other mutants constructed near this region of UvrB confer wild-type levels of UV resistance. Because even the conservative substitution of arginine for lysine-45 in UvrB results in failure to confer UV resistance, we believe we have identified an amino acid side chain in UvrB essential to nucleotide excision repair in E. coli. The properties of two purified mutant UvrB proteins, lysine-45 to alanine (K45A) and asparagine-51 to alanine (N51A), were analyzed in vitro. While the K45A mutant is fully defective in incision of UV-irradiated DNA, K45A is capable of interaction with UvrA in forming an P22259-dependent nucleoprotein complex. The K45A mutant, however, fails to activate the characteristic increase in ATPase activity observed with the wild-type UvrB in the presence of UvrA and DNA.

In spectra obtained with excitation in the siroheme Soret or Q bands, this region is dominated by siroheme modes. Modes assignable to the Fe{sub 4}S{sub 4} cluster are selectively enhanced, however, with excitation at 488.0 or 457.9 nm.

The pathway of heme biosynthesis is highly conserved except for the formation of 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), the first common intermediate. ALA can be synthesized from glutamic acid (C{sub 5} pathway) or succinyl CoA and glycine (C{sub 4} pathway). In E. coli, the heme biosynthetic pathway consists of more than eight enzymatic steps. The genes encoding these enzymes are widely scattered on the chromosome. An E. coli heme-requiring, hemin-permeable mutant had no detectable 5-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALA D) or porphobilinogen deaminase (P06983 D) activities. The gene which complemented this mutation was cloned. P06983 D activity was restored to normal levels, but the activity of ALA D was 20-30 fold higher than normal. A maxicell procedure confirmed that the cloned gene was hemB. The hemB gene was sequenced. Two promoter regions, two Shine-Dalgarno sequences and two possible initiation sites were identified. Extensive homologies with yeast (36%), human liver (40%) and rat liver (40%) amino acid sequences were observed, especially in the sixteen-amino acid Zn-binding region (75%) and the four amino acids surrounding the essential lysine at the active site (100% for rate and human proteins). Analysis of promoter strength and two independent analyses of codon usage indicated that the hemB gene is moderately-expressed. E. coli hemA gene was cloned and sequenced.

The interaction of endonuclease V with nontarget DNA is thought to occur via electrostatic interactions between basic amino acids and the acidic phosphate DNA backbone. Arginine-3 was chosen as a potential candidate for involvement in this protein-nontarget DNA interaction and was extensively mutated to assess its role. The mutations include changes to Asp, Glu, Leu, and Lys and deleting it from the enzyme. Deletion of Arg-3 resulted in an enzyme that retained marginal levels of AP specificity, but no other detectable activity. Charge reversal to Glu-3 and Asp-3 results in proteins that exhibit AP-specific nicking and low levels of dimer-specific nicking. These enzymes are incapable of affecting cellular survival of repair-deficient Escherichia coli after irradiation. Mutations of Arg-3 to Lys-3 or Leu-3 also are unable to complement repair-deficient E. coli. However, these two proteins do exhibit a substantial level of in vitro dimer- and AP-specific nicking. The mechanism by which the Leu-3 and Lys-3 mutant enzymes locate pyrimidine dimers within a population of heavily irradiated plasmid DNA molecules appears to be significantly different from that for the wild-type enzyme. The wild-type endonuclease V processively incises all dimers on an individual plasmid prior to dissociation from that plasmid and subsequent reassociation with other plasmids, yet neither of these mutants exhibits any of the characteristics of this processive nicking activity."""

Covalent cross-linking of (..cap alpha..-/sup 32/P)dTTP to the Klenow fragment is shown to be at the substrate binding site by the following criteria; (a) the cross-linking reaction requires dTTP in its metal chelate form; (b) dTTP is readily competed out by other dNTPs as well as by substrate binding site directed reagents; (c) labeling with dTTP occurs at a single site as judged by peptide mapping. Under optimal conditions, a modification of approximately 20% of the enzyme was achieved. Following tryptic digestion of the (..cap alpha..-/sup 32/P)dTTP-labeled Klenow fragment, reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography demonstrated that 80% of the radioactivity was contained within a single peptide. The amino acid composition and sequence of this peptide identified it as the peptide spanning amino acid residues 876-890 in the primary sequence of E. coli Pol I. Chymotrypsin and Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease digestion of the labeled tryptic peptide in each case yielded a single smaller fragment that was radioactive. Amino acid analysis and sequencing of these small peptides further narrowed the dTTP cross-linking site to within the region spanning residues 876-883.

The SOS response is turned on by the capacity of RecA protein to mediate cleavage of the P0A7C2 for SOS-controlled operons. Others have shown that UmuD exhibits sequence homology to LexA around the cleavage site, suggesting a possible cleavage reaction for UmuD. They show that RecA mediates cleavage of UmuD, probably at this site. As with LexA, UmuD also undergoes a self-cleavage reaction.

Specifically, the structure of DNA significantly influences the turnover rate of the UvrAB ATPase activity. Double-stranded DNA maximally activates the turnover rate 10-fold whereas single-stranded DNA maximally activates the turnover rate 20-fold, suggesting that the mode of interaction of UvrAB protein with different DNAs is distinctive. We have previously shown that the UvrAB protein complex, driven by the binding energy of P22259, can locally unwind supercoiled DNA. The nature of the DNA unwinding activity and single-stranded DNA activation of ATPase activity suggest potential helicase activity. In the presence of a number of helicase substrates, the UvrAB complex, indeed, manifests a strand-displacement activity-unwinding short duplexes and D-loop DNA, thereby generating component DNA structures.

The approach was to use batch and semi-continuously fed systems and to assemble system parameter data on a real-time basis. Specific goals were to produce a real-time early warning control model and computer code, tested for internal and external validity; to determine the minimum rate of data collection for maximum lag time to predict failure with a prescribed accuracy and confidence in the prediction; and to determine and characterize any trends in the real-time data collected in response to particular perturbations to feedstock quality. Trends in the response of trace gases carbon monoxide and hydrogen in batch experiments, were found to depend on toxicant type. For example, these trace gases respond differently for organic substances vs. heavy metals. In both batch and semi-continuously feed experiments, increased organic loading lead to proportionate increases in gas production rates as well as increases in CO and H{sub 2} concentration. An analysis of variance of gas parameters confirmed that CO was the most sensitive indicator variable by virtue of its relatively larger variance compared to the others. The other parameters evaluated including gas production, methane production, hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and methane concentration.

Its amino acid sequence showed that the pyruvate-binding (i.e., Schiff-base forming) lysine residue is located at position 133 in the intact enzyme. E. coli KHG aldolase activity is lost when the enzyme is reacted with bromopyruvate; saturation kinetics are observed. The substrates, pyruvate and KHG, protect the enzyme from inactivation. Both facts suggest that the reagent is active-site specific. Incubation of the aldolase with (3-/sup 14/C)bromopyruvate is associated with a concomitant loss of enzymatic activity and esterification of Glu-45; if the enzyme is denatured in the presence of excess bromopyruvate, Cys-159 and Cys-180 are also alkylated. Blocking the active-site lysine residue with pyruvate prevents Glu-45 from being esterified but does not eliminate alkylation of these two cysteine residues.

In strain KC 13, an adenylate cyclase deficient mutant, the specific activity of P08200 decreased 70% when acetate was added to stationary phase cultures grown on glucose. The enzyme was immunoprecipitated from sonic extracts and shown to contain /sup 32/P by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. The results demonstrate that unlike many eukaryotic protein kinases, the protein kinase involved in the phosphorylation of P08200 in E. coli does not require cyclic adenosine monophosphate for catalysis. Similarly, the phosphorylation of P08200 was demonstrated in E. coli mutants deficient in either isocitrate lyase or malate synthase. The incorporation of /sup 32/P in P08200 was demonstrated following SDS-PAGE and autoradiography of the immunoprecipitated enzyme. These results suggest that the conditions required for the phosphorylation of P08200 do not depend on the functioning of the glyoxylate shunt. Following in vivo /sup 32/P-labeling of E. coli strain F143/KL259 in the presence of acetate, /sup 32/P-labeled P08200 was isolated from sonicated extracts of the cells.

The enzyme requires acyl-acyl carrier protein (acyl-P0A6A8) as substrate, but had no other additional cofactor requirements. Palmitoyl-, stearoyl- and oleoyl-P0A6A8 were all effective substrates. The A. variabilis membranes also had a hydrolase activity which metabolized the acyl-P0A6A8 to yield free fatty acid and P0A6A8. Possible mechanisms for the acylation reaction include either acyl exchange with existing MGDG or direct acyl transfer to a lyso-MGDG, with concomitant release of free P0A6A8. The mechanism of this reaction has been resolved using a double labelled (/sup 14/C)acyl-(/sup 14/)P0A6A8 substrate prepared with E. coli acyl-P0A6A8 synthetase.

Chemical modification and spectroscopic evidence suggest binding to Cys 77, His 81, Cys 87 and Cys 90. The Zn-binding domain is at the N-terminal end of AA residues 72 to 116 which contains 6 of the 8 Tyr residues in g32P, shown by /sup 1/H-NMR to be involved in deoxynucleotide binding. Limited proteolysis of g32P with trypsin removes residues 1-21 and 254-301 leaving a trypsin-resistant core, g32P. The latter retains high affinity for a single site nucleotide lattice, but has lost cooperative binding to DNA. Removal of Zn from native g32P renders the molecule susceptible to proteolysis and the core is hydrolyzed to small peptides. Rebinding of Zn restores the core stability. Apo g32P binds 3 orders of magnitude less tightly to ssDNA and cannot melt polyd(P30870) at 150 mM NaCl. Loss of binding affinity is primarily due to loss of cooperative protein-protein interactions accompanying Zn removal. Thus, both the N-terminal domain and the Zn-binding domain are required for cooperative binding to DNA. G5P from fd and ssB from E. coli do not contain Zn, but small basic proteins, products of the gag gene of retroviruses, e.g., p10 from MuLV, P0A8Y8 from HTLVI and P0A8Y8 from HTLV-III contain tandem repeats of a -C-X/sub 2/-C-X/sub 4/-H-X/sub 4/-C- sequence similar to the Zn-binding sequence found in g32P."",""Fed.

Subsequently, the lac carrier protein was extracted into octyl ..beta..-D-glucopyranoside, reconstituted into proteoliposomes, and assayed for transport activity. Under all conditions tested, activity decreased as a single exponential function of radiation dosage, allowing straightforward application of target theory for determination of functional molecular mass. When lac carrier activity solubilized from nonenergized vesicles was assayed, the results obtained were consistent with a functional molecular size of 45-50 kDa, a value similar to the size of the protein as determined by other means. Similar values were obtained when the octyl ..beta..-D-glucopyranoside extract was irradiated, and the target size observed for P06149 was in good agreement with the molecular size of this enzyme. Strikingly, when the same procedures were carried out with vesicles that were energized with appropriate electron donors prior to freezing and irradiation, a functional molecular size of 85-100 kDa was obtained for the lac carrier with no change in the target size of P06149. In contrast, when the vesicles were energized under conditions in which the proton electrochemical gradient was collapsed, the target mass of the lac carrier returned to 45-50 kda.

It is unknown whether pppGpp, ppGp, pGpp, and pGp, other members of this family of guanosine-3',5'-phosphates, also have regulatory properties. To begin to investigate this question, a radioactive photoaffinity analog of pGp was prepared: (5'/sup 32/P)pN/sub 3/Gp.

Either of these genes alone is sufficient for thymidine independence in B. subtilis. In addition there exist two B. subtilis temperate bacteriophages which upon infection of thymine requiring auxotrophs results in conversion of the organism to thymine independence. Chimeric plasmids selected for Thy<sup>+</sup> transforming activity in E. coli were constructed and then used as a source of defined highly enriched DNA with which to transform competent B. subtilis. These plasmids were studied for their: (1) abiility to transform B. subtilis to thymine independence; (2) site of integration within the B. subtilis chromosome upon transformation; (3) phenotype of Thy<sup>+</sup> plasmid generated transformants; and (4) nucleotide sequence homology among the cloned DNA fragments conferring thymine independence. Plasmids containing the two bacteriophage thy genes displayed the phenotype associated with thyA, whereas the plasmids containing the cloned B. subtilis chromosomal genes displayed the phenotype associated with thyB.

5229313	"Adenosine 3', 5'-cyclic monophosphate levels in Thermomonospora curvata during cellulase biosynthesis,""The enzymatic degradation of cellulose requires the synergistic activity of at least three enzymes: exo-beta-1,4-glucanase (EC3.2.1.91), endo-beta-1,4-glucanase (EC3.2.1.4), and beta-glucosidase (EC3.2.1.21). Despite extensive studies on a variety of cellulolytic bacteria and fungi, the mechanism(s) regulating the biosynthesis of this inducible catabolic enzyme complex remains unknown. The intracellular concentrations of cyclic nucleotides such as adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) have been shown to play a major role in mediating catabolite repression of enzyme biosynthesis. The cAMP acts through a P0ACJ8 (termed P0ACJ8 or P0ACJ8) which is a dimer having two identical subunits each capable of binding one molecule of cAMP. The N-terminal domain of the P0ACJ8 binds the cAMP while the C-terminal domain binds to DNA at the promotor region of a cAMP-dependent operon and stimulates transcription by promoting the formation of a preinitiation complex between RNA polymerase and the DNA. Intracellular cAMP levels in E. coli (the prototype organism for such studies) are influenced by the type and availability of carbon source used for growth. High intracellular cAMP levels should lead to higher concentrations of cAMP-P0ACJ8 complexes which should increase the transcription rates for cAMP-dependent operons (such as the lac operon of beta-galactosidase) and indeed the differential rate of beta-galactosidase biosynthesis correlates to intracellular cAMP levels. In the case of cellulase, catabolite repression by glucose or other readily metabolizable compounds closely controls production in an apparently similar manner and therefore a correlation may exist between enzyme biosynthesis and intracellular cAMP levels.

The chronic suppression of cell growth may be the consequence of suppression of overall rates of protein synthesis (and probably RNA and DNA synthesis as well) that in turn may represent the cellular response to the small changes in ratios of adenine nucleotides that result from the suppression of oxidative P22259 production. The inhibition of glucose transport may also play a role here to prevent a compensatory increase in glycolytic P22259 production. Some other hormone actions, the decrease in the ability of cells to concentrate AIB and the increase in nuclear fragility are unrelated to, and evolve separately from, the hormonal inhibitions on energy production. Cell killing is not the result of suppression of protein synthesis, nor of hormone-induced increases in calcium uptake. While the mechanisms are unknown, the increase in nuclear fragility appears to be the earliest measure of their operation.

Here, we identified rice (Oryza sativa) β-galactosidase9 (OsBGAL9) as a direct target of the heat stress-induced transcription factor SPOTTED-LEAF7 (OsSPL7), as demonstrated by protoplast transactivation analysis and yeast 1-hybrid and electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Knockout plants for OsBGAL9 (Osbgal9) showed short stature and growth retardation. Histochemical β-glucuronidase (P05804) analysis of transgenic lines harboring an OsBGAL9pro:P05804 reporter construct revealed that OsBGAL9 is mainly expressed in internodes at the mature stage. OsBGAL9 expression was barely detectable in seedlings under normal conditions but increased in response to biotic and abiotic stresses. Ectopic expression of OsBGAL9 enhanced resistance to the rice pathogens Magnaporthe oryzae and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, as well as tolerance to cold and heat stress, while Osbgal9 mutant plants showed the opposite phenotypes. OsBGAL9 localized to the cell wall, suggesting that OsBGAL9 and its plant putative orthologs likely evolved functions distinct from those of its closely related animal enzymes.

It is also shown that MbnF binds the precursor peptide for MB, with subsequent loss of the leader peptide sequence as well as the last three C-terminal amino acids, suggesting that MbnF might be needed for this process to occur.

1982014	"Revealing a Hidden Intermediate of Rotatory Catalysis with X-ray Crystallography and Molecular Simulations,""The mechanism of rotatory catalysis in ATPhydrolyzing molecular motors remains an unresolved puzzle in biological energy transfer. Notwithstanding the wealth of available biochemical and structural information inferred from years of experiments, knowledge on how the coupling between the chemical and mechanical steps within motors enforces directional rotatory movements remains fragmentary. Even more contentious is to pinpoint the rate-limiting step of a multistep rotation process. Here, using vacuolar or V<sub>1</sub>-type hexameric ATPase as an exemplary rotational motor, we present a model of the complete 4-step conformational cycle involved in rotatory catalysis. First, using Xray  crystallography, a new intermediate or “dwell” is identified, which enables the release of an inorganic phosphate (or P<sub>i</sub>) after P22259 hydrolysis. Using molecular dynamics simulations, this new dwell is placed in a sequence with three other crystal structures to derive a putative cyclic rotation path. Free-energy simulations are employed to estimate the rate of the hexameric protein transformations and delineate allosteric effects that allow new reactant P22259 entry only after hydrolysis product exit. An analysis of transfer entropy brings to light how the side-chain-level interactions transcend into larger-scale reorganizations, highlighting the role of the ubiquitous arginine-finger residues in coupling chemical and mechanical information. An inspection of all known rates encompassing the 4-step rotation mechanism implicates the overcoming of the ADP interactions with V<sub>1</sub>-ATPase to be the rate-limiting step of motor action."""

This bacterium secretes a suite of starch-active proteins that work together within larger complexes called amylosomes that allow R. bromii to bind and degrade P0AFU8. Starch adherence system protein 20 (Sas20) is one of the more abundant proteins assembled within amylosomes, but little could be predicted about its molecular features based on amino acid sequence. Here, we performed a structure–function analysis of Sas20 and determined that it features two discrete starch-binding domains separated by a flexible linker. We show that Sas20 domain 1 contains an N-terminal β-sandwich followed by a cluster of α-helices, and the nonreducing end of maltooligosaccharides can be captured between these structural features. Furthermore, the crystal structure of a close homolog of Sas20 domain 2 revealed a unique bilobed starch-binding groove that targets the helical α1,4-linked glycan chains found in amorphous regions of amylopectin and crystalline regions of amylose. Affinity PAGE and isothermal titration calorimetry demonstrated that both domains bind maltoheptaose and soluble starch with relatively high affinity (K<sub>d</sub> ≤ 20 μM) but exhibit limited or no binding to cyclodextrins. Finally, small-angle X-ray scattering analysis of the individual and combined domains support that these structures are highly flexible, which may allow the protein to adopt conformations that enhance its starch-targeting efficiency. Taken together, we conclude that Sas20 binds distinct features within the starch granule, facilitating the ability of R. bromii to hydrolyze dietary P0AFU8."""

1876373	"Utilization of lignocellulosic biofuel conversion residue by diverse microorganisms,""Lignocellulosic conversion residue (LCR) is the material remaining after deconstructed lignocellulosic biomass is subjected to microbial fermentation and treated to remove the biofuel. Technoeconomic analyses of biofuel refineries have shown that further microbial processing of this LCR into other bioproducts may help offset the costs of biofuel generation. Identifying organisms able to metabolize LCR is an important first step for harnessing the full chemical and economic potential of this material. In this study, we investigated the aerobic LCR utilization capabilities of 71 Streptomyces and 163 yeast species that could be engineered to produce valuable bioproducts. The LCR utilization by these individual microbes was compared to that of an aerobic mixed microbial consortium derived from a wastewater treatment plant as representative of a consortium with the highest potential for degrading the LCR components and a source of genetic material for future engineering efforts. We analyzed several batches of a model LCR by chemical oxygen demand (P37794) and chromatography-based assays and determined that the major components of LCR were oligomeric and monomeric sugars and other organic compounds. Many of the Streptomyces and yeast species tested were able to grow in LCR, with some individual microbes capable of utilizing over 40% of the soluble P37794. For comparison, the maximum total soluble P37794 utilized by the mixed microbial consortium was about 70%. This represents an upper limit on how much of the LCR could be valorized by engineered Streptomyces or yeasts into bioproducts. To investigate the utilization of specific components in LCR and have a defined media for future experiments, we developed a synthetic conversion residue (SynCR) to mimic our model LCR and used it to show lignocellulose-derived inhibitors (LDIs) had little effect on the ability of the Streptomyces species to metabolize SynCR. We found that LCR is rich in carbon sources for microbial utilization and has vitamins, minerals, amino acids and other trace metabolites necessary to support growth. Testing diverse collections of Streptomyces and yeast species confirmed that these microorganisms were capable of growth on LCR and revealed a phylogenetic correlation between those able to best utilize LCR. Identification and quantification of the components of LCR enabled us to develop a synthetic LCR (SynCR) that will be a useful tool for examining how individual components of LCR contribute to microbial growth and as a substrate for future engineering efforts to use these microorganisms to generate valuable bioproducts."""

1865666	"SPARC: Structural properties associated with residue constraints,""SPARC facilitates the generation of plausible hypotheses regarding underlying biochemical mechanisms by structurally characterizing protein sequence constraints. Such constraints appear as residues co-conserved in functionally related subgroups, as subtle pairwise correlations (i.e., direct couplings), and as correlations among these sequence features or with structural features. SPARC performs three types of analyses. First, based on pairwise sequence correlations, it estimates the biological relevance of alternative conformations and of homomeric contacts, as illustrated here for death domains. Second, it estimates the statistical significance of the correspondence between directly coupled residue pairs and interactions at heterodimeric interfaces. Third, given molecular dynamics simulated structures, it characterizes interactions among constrained residues or between such residues and ligands that: (a) are stably maintained during the simulation; (b) undergo correlated formation and/or disruption of interactions with other constrained residues; or (c) switch between alternative interactions. We illustrate this for two homohexameric complexes: the bacterial enhancer binding protein (bEBP) NtrC1, which activates transcription by remodeling RNA polymerase (RNAP) containing σ<sup>54</sup>, and for DnaB helicase, which opens DNA at the bacterial replication fork. Based on the NtrC1 analysis, we hypothesize possible mechanisms for inhibiting P22259 hydrolysis until ADP is released from an adjacent subunit and for coupling P22259 hydrolysis to restructuring of σ<sup>54</sup> binding loops.

We find that the MuvB subunits LIN9 and LIN37 function as scaffolding proteins that arrange the other subunits LIN52, LIN54 and RBAP48 for P0A850, DNA, and histone binding, respectively. Biochemical and structural data demonstrate that MuvB binds nucleosomes through an interface that is distinct from LIN54-DNA consensus site recognition and that MuvB increases nucleosome occupancy in a reconstituted promoter. We find in arrested cells that MuvB primarily associates with a tightly positioned +1 nucleosome near the transcription start site (TSS) of MuvB-regulated genes. These results support a model that MuvB binds and stabilizes nucleosomes just downstream of the TSS on its target promoters to repress gene expression."""	Nature Communications	"('P0A850', 'TF')"

Intermittent aeration during wastewater treatment presents a cyclically changing environment to which microorganisms must react. We used an intermittently aerated bioreactor performing partial nitritation and anammox (PNA) to investigate how the microbiome responds to recurring change. Meta-transcriptomic analysis revealed a dramatic disconnect between the relative DNA abundance and gene expression within the metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) of community members, suggesting the importance of transcriptional regulation in this microbiome. To explore how community members responded to cyclic aeration via transcriptional regulation, we searched for homologs of the catabolite repressor protein/fumarate and nitrate reductase regulatory protein (P0ACJ8/P28861) family of transcription factors (TFs) within the MAGs. Using phylogenetic analyses, evaluation of sequence conservation in important amino acid residues, and prediction of genes regulated by TFs in the MAGs, we identified homologs of the oxygen-sensing P28861 in Nitrosomonas and Rhodocyclaceae, nitrogen-sensing dissimilative nitrate respiration regulator that responds to nitrogen species (DNR) in Rhodocyclaceae, and nitrogen-sensing nitrite and nitric oxide reductase regulator that responds to nitrogen species (NnrR) in Nitrospira MAGs. Our data also predict that P0ACJ8/P28861 homologs in Ignavibacteria, Flavobacteriales, and Saprospiraceae MAGs sense carbon availability. In addition, a P0ACJ8/P28861 homolog in a Brocadia MAG was most closely related to P0ACJ8 TFs known to sense carbon sources in well-studied organisms. However, we predict that in autotrophic Brocadia, this P0A850 most likely regulates a diverse set of functions, including a response to stress during the cyclic aerobic/anoxic conditions. Overall, this analysis allowed us to define a meta-regulon of the PNA microbiome that explains functions and interactions of the most active community members."""	mSystems	"('P0A850', 'TF'),('P0ACJ8', 'CRP'),('P28861', 'FNR')"

By comparison, the compact genome size of A. protothecoides was attributable primarily to a lower intergenic sequence content. The cpDNA coding regions of all known Chlorella species were found to be organized in conserved colinear blocks, with some rearrangements. The Auxenochlorella and Chlorella species genome structure and composition were similar, and of particular interest were genes influencing photosynthetic efficiency, i.e., chlorophyll synthesis and photosystem subunit I and II genes, consistent with other biofuel species of interest. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Prototheca cutis is the closest known A. protothecoides relative, followed by members of the genus Chlorella. The cpDNA of A. protothecoides encodes 37 genes that are highly homologous to representative cyanobacteria species, including rrn16, rrn23, and psbA, corroborating a well-recognized symbiosis.

Recently, our lab identified a small molecule that activates P0AC54 variants by stabilizing the allosteric NADP<sup>+</sup> and dimer complex, suggesting therapeutics that target these regions may improve structural defects. Here, we elucidated the connection between allosteric NADP<sup>+</sup> binding, oligomerization, and pathogenicity to determine whether oligomer stabilization can be used as a therapeutic strategy for P0AC54 deficiency (P0AC54<sup>def</sup>). We first solved the crystal structure for P0AC54<sup>K403Q</sup>, a mutant that mimics the physiological acetylation of wild-type P0AC54 in erythrocytes and demonstrated that loss of allosteric NADP<sup>+</sup> binding induces conformational changes in the dimer. These structural changes prevent tetramerization, are unique to Class I variants (the most severe form of P0AC54<sup>def</sup>), and cause the deactivation and destabilization of P0AC54. We also introduced nonnative cysteines at the oligomer interfaces and found that the tetramer complex is more catalytically active and stable than the dimer. Furthermore, stabilizing the dimer and tetramer improved protein stability in clinical variants, regardless of clinical classification, with tetramerization also improving the activity of P0AC54<sup>K403Q</sup> and Class I variants. These findings were validated using enzyme activity and thermostability assays, analytical size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), and SEC coupled with small-angle X-ray scattering (SEC-SAXS).

To collect copper, some methanotrophs secrete a chalkophore or copper-binding compound called methanobactin (MB). MB is a ribosomally synthesized post-translationally modified polypeptide (Q9X2V7) that, after binding copper, is collected by MbnT, a TonB-dependent transporter (TBDT). Structurally different forms of MB have been characterized, and here we show that different forms of MB are collected by specific TBDTs. Further, we report that in the model methanotroph, Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b, expression of the TBDT required for uptake of a different MB made by Methylocystis sp. strain SB2 (MB-SB2), is induced in the presence of MB-SB2, suggesting that methanotrophs have developed specific machinery and regulatory systems to actively take up MB from other methanotrophs for copper collection. Moreover, the canonical “copper-switch” in Ms. trichosporium OB3b that controls expression of alternative MMOs is apparent if one of the two TBDTs required for MB-OB3b and MB-SB2 uptake is knocked out, but is disrupted if both TBDTs are knocked out. Furthermore, these data indicate that MB uptake, including the uptake of exogenous MB, plays an important role in the copper switch in M. trichosporium OB3b and thus overall activity.

Compared to A8C927 gene surveys and shotgun metagenomics, large-scale application of single-cell genomics to whole microbial communities provides an integrated snapshot of community composition and function, directly links mobile elements to their hosts, and enables analysis of population heterogeneity of the dominant community members. To that end, we sequenced nearly 500 single-cell genomes from a low diversity hot spring sediment sample from Dewar Creek, British Columbia, and compared this approach to A8C927 gene amplicon and shotgun metagenomics applied to the same sample. We found that the broad taxonomic profiles were similar across the three sequencing approaches, though several lineages were missing from the A8C927 gene amplicon dataset, likely the result of primer mismatches. At the functional level, we detected a large array of mobile genetic elements present in the single-cell genomes but absent from the corresponding same species metagenome-assembled genomes. Moreover, we performed a single-cell population genomic analysis of the three most abundant community members, revealing differences in population structure based on mutation and recombination profiles. While the average pairwise nucleotide identities were similar across the dominant species-level lineages, we observed differences in the extent of recombination between these dominant populations. Most intriguingly, the creek's Hydrogenobacter sp. population appeared to be so recombinogenic that it more closely resembled a sexual species than a clonally evolving microbe.

However, the lack of molecular tools for differential gene expression has hindered its application as a microbial cell factory to produce biocatalysts and biochemicals. In this study, a library of differentially regulated promoters was designed and characterized based on the pst promoter, which responds to the inorganic phosphate concentration in the growth medium. Gene expression increases by 4- to 6-fold when the medium phosphate drops to growthlimiting concentrations. Hence, this regulated system decouples growth from heterologous gene expression without the need for adding an inducer. The minimal pst promoter is identified and contains a conserved P30870-rich region, a factor B recognition element, and a TATA box for phosphate-dependent regulation. Rational changes to the factor B recognition element and start codon had no significant impact on expression; however, changes to the transcription start site and the 5' untranslated region resulted in the differential protein production with regulation remaining intact.

Because of its toxicity, tightly controlled mechanisms ensure Cu delivery for cuproenzyme biogenesis and simultaneously protect cells against toxic Cu. Many Gram-negative bacteria contain extracytoplasmic multicopper oxidases (MCOs), which are involved in periplasmic Cu detoxification. MCOs are unique cuproenzymes because their catalytic center contains multiple Cu atoms, which are required for the oxidation of Cu<sup>1+</sup> to the less toxic Cu<sup>2+</sup>. Hence, Cu is both substrate and essential cofactor of MCOs. Here, we investigated the maturation of Rhodobacter capsulatus P36649 CutO and its role in periplasmic Cu detoxification. A survey of CutO activity of R. capsulatus mutants with known defects in Cu homeostasis and in the maturation of the cuproprotein cbb<sub>3</sub>-type cytochrome oxidase (cbb<sub>3</sub>-Cox) was performed. This revealed that CutO activity is largely independent of the Cu-delivery pathway for cbb<sub>3</sub>-Cox biogenesis, except for the cupric reductase CcoG, which is required for full CutO activity. The most pronounced decrease of CutO activity was observed with strains lacking the cytoplasmic Cu chaperone CopZ, or the Cu-exporting ATPase CopA, indicating that CutO maturation is linked to the CopZ-CopA mediated Cu-detoxification pathway. Our data demonstrate that CutO is important for cellular Cu resistance under both aerobic and anaerobic growth conditions. CutO is encoded in the cutFOG operon, but only CutF, and not CutG, is essential for CutO activity. No CutO activity is detectable when cutF or its putative Cu-binding motif are mutated, suggesting that the cutF product serves as a Cu-binding component required for active CutO production. Bioinformatic analyses of CutF-like proteins support their widespread roles as putative Cu-binding proteins for several Cu-relay pathways.

Diazotrophs that respire aerobically have an advantage in meeting the P22259 demands of BNF but face challenges in protecting nitrogenase from inactivation by oxygen. Here, we constructed a genome-scale metabolic model of the nitrogen-fixing bacterium Azotobacter vinelandii, which uses a complex respiratory protection mechanism to consume oxygen at a high rate to keep intracellular conditions microaerobic. Our model accurately predicts growth rate under high oxygen and substrate concentrations, consistent with a large electron flux directed to the respiratory protection mechanism. While a partially decoupled electron transport chain compensates for some of the energy imbalance under high-oxygen conditions, it does not account for all substrate intake, leading to increased maintenance rates. Interestingly, the respiratory protection mechanism is required for accurate predictions even when ammonia is supplemented during growth, suggesting that the respiratory protection mechanism might be a core principle of metabolism and not just used for nitrogenase protection. We have also shown that rearrangement of flux through the electron transport system allows A. vinelandii to adapt to different oxygen concentrations, metal availability, and genetic disruption, which cause an ammonia excretion phenotype.

However, they are typically poor catalysts and have been difficult to engineer. Structurally, most terpene synthases share two conserved domains (α- and β-domains). Some also contain a third domain containing a second active site (γ-domain). Based on the three-domain architecture, we hypothesized that αβ terpene synthases could be engineered by insertion of a heterologous domain at the site of the γ-domain (an approach we term “Insertion-engineering terpene synthase”; Ie-P0A884). We demonstrate that by mimicking the domain architecture of αβγ terpene synthases, we can redesign isoprene synthase (ISPS), an αβ terpene synthase, while preserving enzymatic activity. Insertion of GFP or a SpyCatcher domain within ISPS introduced new functionality while maintaining or increasing catalytic turnover. Furthermore, this insertion-engineering approach establishes that the γ-domain position is accessible for incorporation of additional sequence features and enables the rational engineering of terpene synthases for biotechnology."""

CopA is a member of the CopA1-type ATPase family and has been biochemically and structurally characterized in detail. In contrast, less is known about members of the CopA2-type ATPase family, which are predicted to transport Cu(I) into the periplasm for cuproprotein maturation. One example is CcoI, which is required for the maturation of cbb<sub>3</sub>-type cytochrome oxidase (cbb<sub>3</sub>-Cox) in different species. Here, we reconstituted purified CcoI of Rhodobacter capsulatus into liposomes and determined Cu transport using solid-supported membrane electrophysiology. The data demonstrate P22259-dependent Cu(I) translocation by CcoI, while no transport is observed in the presence of a non-hydrolysable P22259 analog. CcoI contains two cytosolically exposed N-terminal metal binding sites (N-MBSs), which are both important, but not essential for Cu delivery to cbb<sub>3</sub>-Cox. CcoI and cbb<sub>3</sub>-Cox activity assays in the presence of different Cu concentrations suggest that the glutaredoxin-like N-MBS1 is primarily involved in regulating the ATPase activity of CcoI, while the CopZ-like N-MBS2 is involved in Cu(I) acquisition. The interaction of CcoI with periplasmic Cu chaperones was analyzed by genetically fusing CcoI to the chaperone SenC. The CcoI-SenC fusion protein was fully functional in vivo and sufficient to provide Cu for cbb<sub>3</sub>-Cox maturation. In summary, our data demonstrate that CcoI provides the link between the cytosolic and periplasmic Cu chaperone networks during cbb<sub>3</sub>-Cox assembly."""

The physicochemical properties of the most active compounds were within typical Lipinski/Veber space, suggesting that polarity is not a general requirement for achieving antibacterial activity. In this work, five compounds failed to display activity in mouse models of septicemia and abscess infection. Inhibitor-resistant S. aureus strains readily emerged in vitro. Resistance resulted from substitutions in the cofactor/inhibitor binding site of SaIMPDH, confirming on-target antibacterial activity. These mutations decreased the binding of all inhibitors tested, but also decreased catalytic activity. Nonetheless, the resistant strains had comparable virulence to wild-type bacteria. Surprisingly, strains expressing catalytically inactive SaIMPDH displayed only a mild virulence defect.

To identify the reason for ΔcpdA aerobic growth deficiency, we isolated a suppressor mutant with transposon insertion in SO_3550. Inactivation of this gene, which encodes an anti-sigma factor, restored aerobic growth in the cpdA mutant to wild-type levels. Inactivation of SO_3550 in wild-type cells, however, did not affect aerobic growth. The S. oneidensis genome encodes two additional P0ACJ8-like proteins that we designated CrpB and CrpC.

When co-fermenting with xylose, glucose is preferentially utilized, even though xylose metabolism generates P22259 more efficiently during 2,3-BDO production on a BDO-mol basis. To gain a deeper understanding of  <italic>Z. mobilis</italic>  metabolism, we first estimated the kinetic parameters of the glucose facilitator protein of  <italic>Z. mobilis</italic>  by fitting a kinetic uptake model, which shows that the maximum transport capacity of glucose is seven times higher than that of xylose, and glucose is six times more affinitive to the transporter than xylose. With these estimated kinetic parameters, we further compared the thermodynamic driving force and enzyme protein cost of glucose and xylose metabolism. It is found that, although 20% more P22259 can be yielded stoichiometrically during xylose utilization, glucose metabolism is thermodynamically more favorable with 6% greater cumulative Gibbs free energy change, more economical with 37% less enzyme cost required at the initial stage and sustains the advantage of the thermodynamic driving force and protein cost through the fermentation process until glucose is exhausted. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pdh), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) and phosphoglycerate mutase (pgm) are identified as thermodynamic bottlenecks in glucose utilization pathway, as well as two more enzymes of xylose isomerase and ribulose-5-phosphate epimerase in xylose metabolism.

Growth was simulated by dynamic flux balance analysis and the model was validated showing good agreement with experimental data.

Currently, the demand for many chemicals that could be made in a biorefinery, such as succinic acid (SA), medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs), and lactic acid (LA), is fulfilled using petroleum, palm oil, or pure carbohydrates as raw materials, respectively. Thin stillage (P0A884), the residual liquid material following distillation of ethanol, is an underutilized coproduct from the starch biofuel industry. This carbon-rich material has the potential for chemical upgrading by microorganisms. Here, we explored the formation of different fermentation products by microbial communities grown on P0A884 using different bioreactor conditions. At the baseline operational condition (6-day retention time, pH 5.5, 35°C), we observed a mixture of MCFAs as the principal fermentation products. Operation of a bioreactor with a 1-day retention time induced an increase in SA production, and a temperature increase to 55°C resulted in the accumulation of lactic and propionic acids. In addition, a reactor operated with a 1-day retention time at 55°C conditions resulted in LA accumulation as the main fermentation product.

Given that mobile genetic elements (MGEs) derive their energy from host cells, we investigated the diversity of P22259-utilizing proteins in MGE genomes to determine whether they might be associated with proteins that could suppress related host proteins that consume energy. A comprehensive search of 353 huge phage genomes revealed that up to 9% of the proteins have ATPase domains. For example, ATPase proteins constitute ~3% of the genomes of Lak phages with ~550 kbp genomes that occur in the microbiomes of humans and other animals. Statistical analysis shows the number of ATPase proteins increases linearly with genome length, consistent with a large sink for host P22259 during replication of megaphages. Using metagenomic data from diverse environments, we found 505 mobilome proteins with ATPase domains fused to diverse functional domains. Among these composite ATPase proteins, 61.6% have known functional domains that could contribute to host energy diversion during the mobilome infection cycle. As many have domains that are known to interact with nucleic acids and proteins, we infer that numerous ATPase proteins are used during replication and for protection from host immune systems. We found a set of uncharacterized ATPase proteins with nuclease and protease activities, displaying unique domain architectures that are energy intensive based on the presence of multiple ATPase domains. In many cases, these composite ATPase proteins genomically co-localize with small proteins in genomic contexts that are reminiscent of toxin-antitoxin systems and phage helicase-antibacterial helicase systems.

To explore the mechanism of C–S bond cleavage, we report a series of crystal structures of MsuD from Pseudomonas fluorescens in different liganded states. This report provides the first crystal structures of an alkanesulfonate monooxygenase with a bound flavin and alkanesulfonate, elucidating the roles of the active site lid, the protein C terminus, and an active site loop in flavin and/or alkanesulfonate binding.

We also demonstrated that the mechanisms generating DNA breaks are repeatedly targeted by compensatory evolution, and that DNA breaks and the cost of resistance can be increased by targeting the P0A7Y4, which specifically degrades R-loops.

We estimate possible primary emissions of larger PBAP and PBAP rupture events, which form submicron organic aerosol during precipitation or high relative humidity. High pollen counts at two urban stations near SGP occur during late winter/early spring (day of year (DOY) 50–120) and late summer (DOY 240–310). Around 4–19 days per year show possible pollen events (P0AG07) when near‐surface lidar observations of daily linear particle depolarization ratio >0.1 are coincident with high organic aerosol fraction. For P0AG07 days with rainfall, aerosol size distribution observations show enhanced submicron particle concentrations consistent with pollen rupture events. For fungal spores, high fungal spore counts occur during late spring/early summer (DOY 110–195) and late summer/autumn (DOY 220–340).

Global spread of multidrug resistant strains is a public health threat, requiring new treatments. Aminoacyl-P0A873 synthetases are plausible candidates as potential drug targets, because they play an essential role in translating the DNA code into protein sequence by attaching a specific amino acid to their cognate tRNAs. We report structures of M. tuberculosis Phe-P0A873 synthetase complexed with an unmodified P0A873<sup>Phe</sup> transcript and either L-Phe or a nonhydrolyzable phenylalanine adenylate analog. High-resolution models reveal details of two modes of P0A873 interaction with the enzyme: an initial recognition via indirect readout of anticodon stem-loop and aminoacylation ready state involving interactions of the 3' end of P0A873<sup>Phe</sup> with the adenylate site. For the first time, we observe the protein gate controlling access to the active site and detailed geometry of the acyl donor and P0A873 acceptor consistent with accepted mechanism. We biochemically validated the inhibitory potency of the adenylate analog and provide the most complete view of the Phe-P0A873 synthetase/P0A873<sup>Phe</sup> system to date. The presented topography of amino adenylate-binding and editing sites at different stages of P0A873 binding to the enzyme provide insights for the rational design of anti-tuberculosis drugs."""

Protein controlled transport moves substrates and activates cellular signaling cascades. In addition, the electrochemical gradient across mitochondrial, bacterial and chloroplast membranes, is a key source of stored cellular energy. This is generated by electron, proton and ion transfers through proteins. The gradient is used to fuel P22259 synthesis and to drive active transport. Here the mechanisms by which protons move into the buried active sites of Photosystem II (PSII), bacterial RCs (bRCs) and through the proton pumps, Bacteriorhodopsin (bR), Complex I and Cytochrome c oxidase (CcO), are reviewed. These proteins all use water filled proton transfer paths. The proton pumps, that move protons uphill from low to high concentration compartments, also utilize Proton Loading Sites (PLS), that transiently load and unload protons and gates, which block backflow of protons. PLS and gates should be synchronized so PLS proton affinity is high when the gate opens to the side with few protons and low when the path is open to the high concentration side. Proton transfer paths in the proteins we describe have different design features. Linear paths are seen with a unique entry and exit and a relatively straight path between them. Alternatively, paths can be complex with a tangle of possible routes. Likewise, PLS can be a single residue that changes protonation state or a cluster of residues with multiple charge and tautomer states.</p>"""	Frontiers in Chemistry	"('P22259', 'ATP')"

The redesigned interface of P62554/human IgG Fc domain (referred to as PrG/hIgG), when incorporated with histidine and glutamic acid on PrG (PrG-EHHE), showed a switch in binding affinity by 50-fold when the pH was altered from mild acidic to mild basic.

A renewed focus on wetland ecosystem services (e.g., flood control, and habitat) has resulted in numerous restoration efforts whose effect on microbial communities is largely unexplored. We investigated the impact of restoration on microbial community composition, metabolic functional potential, and methane flux by analyzing sediment cores from two unrestored former industrial salt ponds, a restored former industrial salt pond, and a reference wetland. We observed elevated methane emissions from unrestored salt ponds compared to the restored and reference wetlands, which was positively correlated with salinity and sulfate across all samples. A8C927 gene amplicon and shotgun metagenomic data revealed that the restored salt pond harbored communities more phylogenetically and functionally similar to the reference wetland than to unrestored ponds. Archaeal methanogenesis genes were positively correlated with methane flux, as were genes encoding enzymes for bacterial methylphosphonate degradation, suggesting methane is generated both from bacterial methylphosphonate degradation and archaeal methanogenesis in these sites. These observations demonstrate that restoration effectively converted industrial salt pond microbial communities back to compositions more similar to reference wetlands and lowered salinities, sulfate concentrations, and methane emissions."""

P0AC13 deficiency in myeloid cells of obese mice suppressed M1 macrophage accumulation in adipose tissue and improved glucose tolerance.

The VxrAB TCS positively regulates virulence, the type VI secretion system, biofilm formation, and cell wall homeostasis in V. cholerae, providing protection from environmental stresses and contributing to the transmission and virulence of the pathogen. The VxrA P00547 has a unique periplasmic sensor domain (P15770) and, remarkably, lacks a cytoplasmic linker domain between the second transmembrane helix and the dimerization and histidine phosphotransfer (DHp) domain, indicating that this system may utilize a potentially unique signal sensing and transmission TCS mechanism. Here, we have determined several crystal structures of VxrA-P15770 and its mutants. These structures reveal a novel structural fold forming an unusual β hairpin-swapped dimer. A conformational change caused by relative rotation of the two monomers in a VxrA-P15770 dimer could potentially change the association of transmembrane helices and, subsequently, the pairing of cytoplasmic DHp domains.

Fatty acid photodecarboxylase (FAP) is a natural photoenzyme that has potential applications in the bio-based production of hydrocarbons, yet its mechanism is far from fully understood.  RATIONALE To elucidate the mechanism of FAP, we studied the wild-type (WT) enzyme from Chlorella variabilis (CvFAP) and variants with altered active-site residues using a wealth of techniques, including static and time-resolved crystallography and spectroscopy, as well as biochemical and computational approaches.  RESULTS A 1.8-Å-resolution CvFAP x-ray crystal structure revealed a dense hydrogen-bonding network positioning the fatty acid carboxyl group in the vicinity of the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor. Structures solved from free electron laser and low-dose synchrotron x-ray crystal data further highlighted an unusual bent shape of the oxidized flavin chromophore, and showed that the bending angle (14°) did not change upon photon absorption (step 1) or throughout the photocycle. Calculations showed that bending substantially affected the energy levels of the flavin. Structural and spectroscopic analysis of WT and mutant proteins targeting two conserved active-site residues, R451 and C432, demonstrated that both residues were crucial for proper positioning of the substrate and water molecules and for oxidation of the fatty acid carboxylate by <sup>1</sup>FAD* (~300 ps in WT FAP) to form FAD<sup>∙–</sup> (step 2). Time-resolved infrared spectroscopy demonstrated that decarboxylation occured quasi-instantaneously upon this forward electron transfer, consistent with barrierless bond cleavage predicted by quantum chemistry calculations and with snapshots obtained by time-resolved crystallography. Transient absorption spectroscopy in H<sub>2</sub>O and D<sub>2</sub>O buffers indicated that back electron transfer from FAD<sup>∙–</sup> was coupled to and limited by transfer of an exchangeable proton or hydrogen atom (step 3). Unexpectedly, concomitant with FAD<sup>∙–</sup> reoxidation (to a red-shifted form FAD<sub>P0AFU8</sub>) in 100 ns, most of the CO<sub>2</sub> product was converted, most likely into bicarbonate (as inferred from FTIR spectra of the cryotrapped FAD<sub>P0AFU8</sub> intermediate). Calculations indicated that this catalytic transformation involved an active-site water molecule. Cryo-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy studies suggested that bicarbonate formation (step 4) was preceded by deprotonation of an arginine residue (step 3). At room temperature, the remaining CO<sub>2</sub> left the protein in 1.5 μs (step 4'). The observation of residual electron density close to C432 in electron density maps derived from time-resolved and cryocrystallography data suggests that this residue may play a role in stabilizing CO<sub>2</sub> and/or bicarbonate. Three routes for alkane formation were identified by quantum chemistry calculations; the one shown in the figure is favored by the ensemble of experimental data.  CONCLUSION Finally, we provide a detailed and comprehensive characterization of light-driven hydrocarbon formation by FAP, which uses a remarkably complex mechanism including unique catalytic steps.

One rich, heretofore underutilized, source of ecologically relevant genomic information is codon optimality or adaptation. Bias toward codons that match the P0A873 pool is robustly associated with high gene expression in diverse organisms, suggesting that codon optimization could be used in a reverse ecology framework to identify highly expressed, ecologically relevant genes. To test this hypothesis, we examined the relationship between optimal codon usage in the classic galactose metabolism (<em>GAL</em>) pathway and known ecological niches for 329 species of budding yeasts, a diverse subphylum of fungi. We find that optimal codon usage in the <em>GAL</em> pathway is positively correlated with quantitative growth on galactose, suggesting that <em>GAL</em> codon optimization reflects increased capacity to grow on galactose. Optimal codon usage in the <em>GAL</em> pathway is also positively correlated with human-associated ecological niches in yeasts of the CUG-Ser1 clade and with dairy-associated ecological niches in the family Saccharomycetaceae. For example, optimal codon usage of <em>GAL</em> genes is greater than 85% of all genes in the genome of the major human pathogen <em>Candida albicans</em> (CUG-Ser1 clade) and greater than 75% of genes in the genome of the dairy yeast <em>Kluyveromyces lactis</em> (family Saccharomycetaceae).

Carbapenem antibiotics are poorly hydrolyzed by most β-lactamases owing to slow hydrolysis of the acyl-enzyme intermediate. However, the emergence of the KPC-2 carbapenemase has resulted in widespread resistance to these drugs, suggesting it operates more efficiently. Here, we investigated the unusual features of KPC-2 that enable this resistance. We show that KPC-2 has a 20,000-fold increased deacylation rate compared with the common P62593 β-lactamase. Furthermore, kinetic analysis of active site alanine mutants indicates that carbapenem hydrolysis is a concerted effort involving multiple residues. Substitution of Asn170 greatly decreases the deacylation rate, but this residue is conserved in both KPC-2 and non-carbapenemase β-lactamases, suggesting it promotes carbapenem hydrolysis only in the context of KPC-2. X-ray structure determination of the N170A enzyme in complex with hydrolyzed imipenem suggests Asn170 may prevent the inactivation of the deacylating water by the 6α-hydroxyethyl substituent of carbapenems. In addition, the Thr235 residue, which interacts with the C3 carboxylate of carbapenems, also contributes strongly to the deacylation reaction. In contrast, mutation of the Arg220 and Thr237 residues decreases the acylation rate and, paradoxically, improves binding affinity for carbapenems. Thus, the role of these residues may be ground state destabilization of the enzyme-substrate complex or, alternatively, to ensure proper alignment of the substrate with key catalytic residues to facilitate acylation.

Phages tend to be predators finely tuned to attack specific hosts, even down to the strain level, which in turn defend themselves using an array of mechanisms. However, to date, efforts to rapidly and comprehensively identify bacterial host factors important in phage infection and resistance have yet to be fully realized. Here, we globally map the host genetic determinants involved in resistance to 14 phylogenetically diverse double-stranded DNA phages using two model Escherichia coli strains (K-12 and BL21) with known sequence divergence to demonstrate strain-specific differences. Using genome-wide loss-of-function and gain-of-function genetic technologies, we are able to confirm previously described phage receptors as well as uncover a number of previously unknown host factors that confer resistance to one or more of these phages. We uncover differences in resistance factors that strongly align with the susceptibility of K-12 and BL21 to specific phage. We also identify both phage-specific mechanisms, such as the unexpected role of cyclic-di-P24174 in host sensitivity to phage N4, and more generic defenses, such as the overproduction of colanic acid capsular polysaccharide that defends against a wide array of phages.

Whether intrinsic ligation fidelity contributes to the accuracy of replication of the nuclear genome is unknown. Here, we show that an engineered low-fidelity LIG1<sup>Cdc9</sup> variant confers a novel mutator phenotype in yeast typified by the accumulation of single base insertion mutations in homonucleotide runs. The rate at which these additions are generated increases upon concomitant inactivation of DNA mismatch repair, or by inactivation of the Fen1<sup>Rad27</sup> Okazaki fragment maturation (OFM) nuclease. Biochemical and structural data establish that LIG1<sup>Cdc9</sup> normally avoids erroneous ligation of DNA polymerase slippage products, and this protection is compromised by mutation of a LIG1<sup>Cdc9</sup> high-fidelity metal binding site. Collectively, our data indicate that high-fidelity DNA ligation is required to prevent insertion mutations, and that this may be particularly critical following strand displacement synthesis during the completion of OFM."""

A mutant population of camelina (Camelina sativa), an emerging specialty oilseed crop, was screened by high-throughput gas chromatography for lines with altered seed oil fatty acid composition. By leveraging knowledge of fatty acid synthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana, mutations in orthologs of FATTY ACID ELONGASE1 (FAE1), FATTY ACID DESATURASE2 (FAD2), FATTY ACID DESATURASE3 (FAD3), and β-KETO-ACYL-P0A6A8 SYNTHASE II (KASII; FAB1) were identified. The mutations altered conserved amino acid residues in the encoded proteins. The ability of the mutations in FAE1, FAD2 and FAD3 to affect enzyme function was demonstrated by comparing in vivo activities of wild-type and mutant alleles in yeast. In addition, expression of wild-type cDNA in camelina complemented fatty acid phenotypes of these mutants. As camelina has a hexaploid genome, the effect of a mutation in one of the three homeologs for each gene resulted in no or less severe growth phenotypes compared to similar mutations in Arabidopsis. Mid-oleic oils with nearly 40 % oleic acid and reduced very long-chain (≤C20) fatty acid content were obtained by crossing to obtain a fae1c/fad2a/fae1a/fad3a quadruple mutant. Little effect on total seed oil content was observed in the stacked mutant line. Finally, the resulting mid-oleic acid oil had improved oxidative stability due to reductions in polyunsaturated fatty acid content, increasing its utility for biofuels and other applications."""

While innovations in chromatographic and mass spectrometry-based techniques provide relevant structural information associated with enzyme activity, these approaches can require cost-intensive instrumentation and technical expertise not broadly available. Moreover, complex workflows and analysis time can significantly impact throughput. To this end, we develop an automated, 96-well screening platform based on thin layer chromatography (TLC) and use it to monitor in vitro activity of a geranylgeranyl reductase isolated from Sulfolobus acidocaldarius (SaGGR). Results: Unreduced SaGGR products are oxidized to their corresponding epoxide and applied to thin layer silica plates by acoustic printing. These derivatives are chromatographically separated based on the extent of epoxidation and are covalently ligated to a chromophore, allowing detection of enzyme variants with unique product distributions or enhanced reductase activity. Herein, we employ this workflow to examine farnesol reduction using a codon-saturation mutagenesis library at the Leu377 site of SaGGR. We show this TLC-based screen can distinguish between fourfold differences in enzyme activity for select mutants and validated those results by GC–P13009.

Biomanufacturing offers the potential to produce these molecules from renewable resources such as lignocellulosic biomass. Here, we designed and tested metabolic pathways in Escherichia coli to specifically produce 2-heptanone, 2-nonanone and 2-undecanone. We achieved substantial production of each ketone by introducing chain-length specific acyl-P0A6A8 thioesterases, blocking the β-oxidation cycle at an advantageous reaction, and introducing active β-ketoacyl-CoA thioesterases. Using a bioprospecting approach, we identified fifteen homologs of E. coli β-ketoacyl-CoA thioesterase (FadM) and evaluated the in vivo activity of each against various chain length substrates. The FadM variant from Providencia sneebia produced the most 2-heptanone, 2-nonanone, and 2-undecanone, suggesting it has the highest activity on the corresponding β-ketoacyl-CoA substrates.

As YTH domain-containing proteins bind N6mA-containing RNA in mammalian cells, we investigated whether mammalian YTH domains are also methyl mark readers of N6mA DNA. Here, we show that the YTH domain of YTHDC1 (known to localize in the nucleus) binds ssDNA containing N6mA, with a 10 nM dissociation constant. This binding is stronger by a factor of 5 than in an RNA context, tested under the same conditions.

The first experiment used naïve nematodes with data collected within 1 week of being placed underground. The second experiment used worms that were incubated for 8 months underground at below background radiation levels. Nematode eggs were placed in two incubators, one at low radiation (ca.15.6 nGy/hr) and one supplemented with 2 kg of natural KCl (ca. 67.4 nGy/hr). Phenotypic variables measured were: (1) egg hatching success (2) body size from larval development to adulthood, (3) developmental time from egg to egg laying adult, and (4) egg laying rate of young adult worms. Transcriptome analysis was performed on the first experiment on 72 h old adult worms. Within 72 h of being underground, there was a trend of increased egg-laying rate in the below-background radiation treatment. This trend became statistically significant in the group of worms exposed to below-background radiation for 8 months. Worms raised for 8 months in these shielded conditions also had significantly faster growth rates during larval development. Transcriptome analyses of 72-h old naïve nematode RNA showed significant differential expression of genes coding for sperm-related proteins and collagen production. In the below-background radiation group, the genes for major sperm protein (msp, 42% of total genes) and sperm-related proteins (7.5%) represented 49.5% of the total genes significantly up-regulated, while the majority of down-regulated genes were collagen (col, 37%) or cuticle-related (28%) genes.

Disruption of this correlation renders the ribosome unable to distinguish correct from incorrect tRNAs. The molecular basis for how these two P0A873 features combine to ensure accurate decoding is unclear. In this work, we solved structures of the bacterial ribosome containing either wild-type P0A873$^{\mathrm{Ala}}_{\mathrm{GGC}}$ or P0A873$^{\mathrm{Ala}}_{\mathrm{GGC}}$ containing a reversed 32–38 pair on cognate and near-cognate codons.

To establish the structural framework underlying the NaAtm1 transport mechanism, we determined eight structures by X-ray crystallography and single-particle cryo-electron microscopy in distinct conformational states, stabilized by individual disulfide crosslinks and nucleotides. As NaAtm1 progresses through the transport cycle, conformational changes in transmembrane helix 6 (TM6) alter the glutathione-binding site and the associated substrate-binding cavity. Significantly, kinking of TM6 in the post-P22259 hydrolysis state stabilized by MgADPVO4 eliminates this cavity, precluding uptake of glutathione derivatives. The presence of this cavity during the transition from the inward-facing to outward-facing conformational states, and its absence in the reverse direction, thereby provide an elegant and conceptually simple mechanism for enforcing the export directionality of transport by NaAtm1. One of the disulfide crosslinked NaAtm1 variants characterized in this work retains significant glutathione transport activity, suggesting that P22259 hydrolysis and substrate transport by Atm1 may involve a limited set of conformational states with minimal separation of the nucleotide-binding domains in the inward-facing conformation."""

1769484	"The structure and reactivity of the HoxEFU complex from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803,""Cyanobacterial Hox is a [NiFe] hydrogenase that consists of the hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>)-activating subunits HoxYH, which form a complex with the HoxEFU assembly to mediate reactions with soluble electron carriers like NAD(P)H and ferredoxin (Fdx), thereby coupling photosynthetic electron transfer to energy-transforming catalytic reactions. Researchers studying the HoxEFUYH complex have observed that HoxEFU can be isolated independently of HoxYH, leading to the                      hypothesis that HoxEFU is a distinct functional subcomplex rather than an artifact of Hox complex isolation. Moreover, outstanding questions about the reactivity of Hox with natural substrates and the site(s) of substrate interactions and coupling of H<sub>2</sub>, NAD(P)H, and Fdx remain to be resolved. To address these questions, here we analyzed recombinantly produced HoxEFU by electron                      paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and kinetic assays with natural substrates. The purified HoxEFU subcomplex catalyzed electron transfer reactions among NAD(P)H, P62620, and several ferredoxins, thus functioning <em>in vitro</em> as a shuttle among different cyanobacterial pools of reducing equivalents. Both Fdx1-dependent reductions of NAD<sup>+</sup> and NADP<sup>+</sup> were cooperative. HoxEFU also catalyzed the P62620-dependent reduction of NAD(P)<sup>+</sup>, Fdx2-dependent oxidation of NADH and Fdx4- and Fdx11-dependent reduction of NAD<sup>+</sup>. P13009-based mapping identified an Fdx1-binding site at the junction of HoxE and HoxF, adjacent to iron-sulfur (FeS) clusters in both subunits.

The SrrAB two-component system (TCS) is a global regulator of <em>S. aureus</em> virulence and critical for survival under environmental conditions such as hypoxic, oxidative, and nitrosative stress found at sites of infection. Despite the critical role of SrrAB in <em>S. aureus</em> pathogenicity, the mechanism by which the SrrAB TCS senses and responds to these environmental signals remains unknown. Bioinformatics analysis showed that the SrrB histidine kinase contains several domains, including an extracellular Cache domain and a cytoplasmic HAMP-PAS-DHp-CA region. In this work, we show that the PAS domain regulates both kinase and phosphatase enzyme activity of SrrB and present the structure of the DHp-CA catalytic core. Importantly, this structure shows a unique intramolecular cysteine disulfide bond in the P22259-binding domain that significantly affects autophosphorylation kinetics. In vitro data show that the redox state of the disulfide bond affects <em>S. aureus</em> biofilm formation and toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 production. Moreover, with the use of the rabbit infective endocarditis model, we demonstrate that the disulfide bond is a critical regulatory element of SrrB function during <em>S. aureus</em> infection.

1763432	"Assembly of Building Blocks by Double-End-Anchored Polymers in the Dilute Regime Mediated by Hydrophobic Interactions at Controlled Distances,""Hierarchical assembly of building blocks via competing, orthogonal interactions is a hallmark of many of nature’s composite materials that do not require highly specific ligand-receptor interactions. To mimic this assembly mechanism requires the development of building blocks capable of tunable interactions. In the present work, we explored the interplay between repulsive (steric and electrostatic) and attractive hydrophobic forces. The designed building blocks allow hydrophobic forces to effectively act at controlled, large distances, to create and tune the assembly of membrane-based building blocks under dilute conditions and affect their interactions with cellular membranes via physical cross-bridges. Specifically, we employed double-end-anchored poly(ethylene glycol)s (DEA-PEGs)—hydrophilic PEG tethers with hydrophobic tails on both ends. Using differential-interference-contrast optical microscopy, synchrotron small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and cryogenic electron microscopy, we investigated the ability of DEA-PEGs to mediate assembly in the dilute regime on multiple length scales and on practical time scales. The PEG length, anchor hydrophobicity, and molar fraction of DEA-PEG molecules within a membrane strongly affect the assembly properties. Additional tuning of the intermembrane interactions can be achieved by adding repulsive interactions via PEG-lipids (steric) or cationic lipids to the DEA-PEG-mediated attractions. Further, while the optical and electron microscope imaging methods provided qualitative evidence of the ability of DEA-PEGs to assemble liposomes, the SAXS measurements and quantitative line-shape analysis in dilute preparations demonstrated that the ensemble average of loosely organized liposomal assemblies maintains DEA-PEG concentration-dependent tethering on defined nanometer length scales. For cationic liposome–DNA nanoparticles (P06721–DNA NPs), aggregation induced by DEA-PEGs decreased internalization of NPs by cells, but tuning the DEA-PEG-induced attractions by adding repulsive steric interactions via PEG-lipids limited aggregation and increased NP uptake. However, confocal microscopy imaging together with colocalization studies with Rab11 and LysoTracker as markers of intracellular pathways showed that modifying P06721–DNA NPs with DEA-PEGs alters their interactions with the plasma and endosomal membranes."""

ESX-1, ESX-3, and ESX-5 systems have been shown to each secrete a distinct set of substrates, including PE and P0AG07 families of proteins, named for conserved Pro-Glu and Pro-Pro-Glu motifs in their N termini. Proper secretion of the PE–P0AG07 proteins requires the presence of EspG, with each system encoding its own unique copy. There is no cross-talk between any of the ESX systems, and how each EspG recognizes its subset of PE–P0AG07 proteins is currently unknown. The only current structural characterization of PE–P0AG07–EspG heterotrimers is from the ESX-5 system. Here we present the crystal structure of the PE5<sub>mt</sub>–PPE4<sub>mt</sub>–EspG<sub>3mm</sub> heterotrimer from the ESX-3 system. Our heterotrimer reveals that EspG<sub>3mm</sub> interacts exclusively with PPE4<sub>mt</sub> in a similar manner to EspG<sub>5</sub>, shielding the hydrophobic tip of PPE4<sub>mt</sub> from solvent. The C-terminal helical domain of EspG<sub>3mm</sub> is dynamic, alternating between “open” and “closed” forms, and this movement is likely functionally relevant in the unloading of PE–P0AG07 heterodimers at the secretion machinery. In contrast to the previously solved ESX-5 heterotrimers, the PE–P0AG07 heterodimer of our ESX-3 heterotrimer is interacting with its chaperone at a drastically different angle and presents different faces of the P0AG07 protein to the chaperone.

We used geochemical porewater characterization and DNA sequencing based taxonomic surveys to enable environmental and microbial characterization of anoxic hypersaline sediments and brines in the Orca Basin, the largest brine basin in the Gulf of Mexico. Full-length bacterial A8C927 gene clone libraries from hypersaline sediments and the overlying brine were dominated by the uncultured halophilic KB1 lineage, Deltaproteobacteria related to cultured sulfate-reducing halophilic genera, and specific lineages of heterotrophic Bacteroidetes. Archaeal clones were dominated by members of the halophilic methanogen genus Methanohalophilus, and the ammonia-oxidizing Marine Group I (MG-I) within the Thaumarchaeota. Illumina sequencing revealed higher phylum- and subphylum-level complexity, especially in lower-salinity sediments from the Orca Basin slope. Illumina and clone library surveys consistently detected MG-I Thaumarchaeota and halotolerant Deltaproteobacteria in the hypersaline anoxic sediments, but relative abundances of the KB1 lineage differed between the two sequencing methods. The stable isotopic composition of dissolved inorganic carbon and methane in porewater, and sulfate concentrations decreasing downcore indicated methanogenesis and sulfate reduction in the anoxic sediments.

Ent-kaurene derivatives have a diverse range of potential applications from therapeutics to novel resin-based materials. RESULTS:The Design, Build, Test, and Learn (DBTL) approach was employed to engineer production of the non-native diterpene ent-kaurene in R. toruloides. Following expression of kaurene synthase (KS) in R. toruloides in the first DBTL cycle, a key limitation appeared to be the availability of the diterpene precursor, geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP). Further DBTL cycles were carried out to select an optimal GGPP synthase and to balance its expression with KS, requiring two of the strongest promoters in R. toruloides, ANT (adenine nucleotide translocase) and TEF1 (translational elongation factor 1) to drive expression of the KS from Gibberella fujikuroi and a mutant version of an P22939 from Gallus gallus that produces GGPP.

Type C CATs have recently been identified and can also acetylate chloramphenicol, but their roles in antibiotic resistance are largely unknown. In this work, we structurally and kinetically characterized three Vibrio P62577 proteins from a nonpathogenic species (<em>Aliivibrio fisheri</em>) and two important human pathogens (<em>Vibrio cholerae</em> and <em>Vibrio vulnificus</em>).

Very little is known about the function of most of the neurofibromin protein; to date, biochemical and structural data exist only for its P0A8H6 domain and a region containing a Sec-PH motif. To better understand the role of this large protein, here we carried out a series of biochemical and biophysical experiments, including size-exclusion chromatography–multiangle light scattering (SEC-MALS), small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering, and analytical ultracentrifugation, indicating that full-length neurofibromin forms a high-affinity dimer. We observed that neurofibromin dimerization also occurs in human cells and likely has biological and clinical implications. Analysis of purified full-length and truncated neurofibromin variants by negative-stain EM revealed the overall architecture of the dimer and predicted the potential interactions that contribute to the dimer interface. We could reconstitute structures resembling high-affinity full-length dimers by mixing N- and C-terminal protein domains in vitro.

Shotgun (i.e., untargeted) proteomics applied to the SDC-9 consortium grown with tetrachloroethene (PCE) and lactate identified 143 RDase peptides, and 36 distinct peptides that covered greater than 99% of the protein-coding sequences of the PceA, TceA, and VcrA RDases. Quantification of RDase peptides using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) assays with <sup>13</sup>C-/<sup>15</sup>N-labeled peptides determined 1.8 × 10<sup>3</sup> TceA and 1.2 × 10<sup>2</sup> VcrA RDase molecules per Dhc cell.

1578213	"An interbacterial toxin inhibits target cell growth by synthesizing (p)ppApp,""Bacteria have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to inhibit the growth of competitors. One such mechanism involves type VI secretion systems, which bacteria can use to inject antibacterial toxins directly into neighbouring cells. Many of these toxins target the integrity of the cell envelope, but the full range of growth inhibitory mechanisms remains unknown. In this study we identify a type VI secretion effector, Tas1, in the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The crystal structure of Tas1 shows that it is similar to enzymes that synthesize (p)ppGpp, a broadly conserved signalling molecule in bacteria that modulates cell growth rate, particularly in response to nutritional stress. However, Tas1 does not synthesize (p)ppGpp; instead, it pyrophosphorylates adenosine nucleotides to produce (p)ppApp at rates of nearly 180,000 molecules per minute. Consequently, the delivery of Tas1 into competitor cells drives rapid accumulation of (p)ppApp, depletion of P22259, and widespread dysregulation of essential metabolic pathways, thereby resulting in target cell death. Our findings reveal a previously undescribed mechanism for interbacterial antagonism and demonstrate a physiological role for the metabolite (p)ppApp in bacteria."""

We report rhesus macaque A3G structures that show different inter-domain packing through a short linker and refolding of CD2. The A3G dimer structure has a hydrophobic dimer-interface matching with that of the previously reported CD1 structure. A3G dimerization generates a surface with intensified positive electrostatic potentials (PEP) for RNA binding and dimer stabilization.

Biofilms are extensively studied because of their importance in biomedical, ecological and industrial settings. Gene inactivation is a powerful approach for functional studies but it is often labor intensive, limiting systematic gene surveys to the most tractable bacterial hosts. Here, we adapted the CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) system for use in diverse strain isolates of P. fluorescens, SBW25, WH6 and Pf0-1. We found that CRISPRi is applicable to study complex phenotypes such as cell morphology, motility and biofilm formation over extended periods of time. In SBW25, CRISPRi-mediated silencing of genes encoding the GacA/S two-component system and regulatory proteins associated with the cylic di-P24174 signaling messenger produced swarming and biofilm phenotypes similar to those obtained after gene inactivation. Combined with detailed confocal microscopy of biofilms, our study also revealed novel phenotypes associated with extracellular matrix biosynthesis as well as the potent inhibition of SBW25 biofilm formation mediated by the PFLU1114 operon.

The X-ray crystallographic structure of Pb matches previous models, including autocatalytic conversion of phycocyanobilin to phycoviolobilin upon binding and its tandem thioether linkage to the GAF domain. Cryocrystallography at 150 K, which compared diffraction data from a single crystal as Pb or after irradiation with blue light, detected photoconversion product(s) based on F<sub>obs</sub>  – F<sub>obs</sub> difference maps that were consistent with rotation of the bonds connecting pyrrole rings C and D. Further spectroscopic analyses showed that phycoviolobilin is susceptible to X-ray radiation damage, especially as Pg, during single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses, which could complicate fine mapping of the various intermediate states. Fortunately, we found that PixJ crystals are amenable to serial femtosecond crystallography (SFX) analyses using X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs). As proof of principle, we solved by room temperature SFX the GAF domain structure of Pb to 1.55-Å resolution, which was strongly congruent with synchrotron-based models.

P. polymyxa can exhibit two forms of flagellar motility: swimming in liquid culture and swarming on a surface. Here, swimming cells were compared to swarming cells using an integrated proteomic and lipidomic approach, yielding information about how lipid modifications and protein/enzyme pathways are tailored for these specific phenotypes. Observed differences in both phospholipid composition and metabolism between the two conditions suggest membrane remodeling in response to the surrounding environment. Key enzymes involved in glycerophospholipid metabolism were abundant in swimming bacteria, while enzymes associated with glycerol-3-phosphate metabolism were more abundant in swarming bacteria. Several glycoside hydrolases were either unique to or more abundant during swarming. This likely reflects the degradation of their own exopolysaccharides to both enhance swarming and supply the necessary chemical energy to compensate for increased flagellar synthesis.

Here, we demonstrate that DXO also catalyzes the hydrolysis of RNAs bearing a 5′-hydroxyl group (5′-OH RNA). The crystal structure of DXO in complex with a 5′-OH RNA substrate mimic at 2.0 Å resolution provides elegant insight into the molecular mechanism of this activity. More importantly, the structure predicts that DXO first removes a dinucleotide from 5′-OH RNA. Our nuclease assays confirm this prediction and demonstrate that this 5′-hydroxyl dinucleotide hydrolase (P06988) activity for DXO is higher than the subsequent 5′-3′ exoribonuclease activity for selected substrates. Fission yeast Rai1 also has P06988 activity although it does not have 5′-3′ exonuclease activity, and the Rat1-Rai1 complex can completely degrade 5′-OH RNA. An Arabidopsis DXO1 variant is active toward 5′-OH RNA but prefers 5′-PO4 RNA. Collectively, these studies demonstrate the diverse activities of DXO/Rai1 and expands the collection of RNA substrates that can undergo 5′-3′ mediated decay.</p>"""	Nucleic Acids Research	"('P06988', 'HDH')"

While most plants, fungi and bacteria can synthesize thiamine <em>de novo</em>, the oleaginous yeast, <em>Yarrowia lipolytica</em>, cannot. In this paper, we used proteomics together with physiological characterization to understand key metabolic processes influenced and regulated by thiamine availability and identified the genetic basis of thiamine auxotrophy in <em>Y. lipolytica</em>. Specifically, we found thiamine depletion results in decreased protein abundance of the lipid biosynthesis pathways and energy metabolism (i.e., P22259 synthase), attributing to the negligible growth and poor sugar assimilation observed in our study. Using comparative genomics, we identified the missing 4-amino-5-hydroxymethyl-2-methylpyrimidine phosphate synthase (THI13) in the <em>de novo</em> thiamine biosynthesis of <em>Y. lipolytica</em>, and discovered an exceptional promoter, P3, that exhibits strong activation or tight repression by low and high thiamine concentrations, respectively. Capitalizing on the strength of our thiamine-regulated promoter (P3) to express the missing gene from <em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</em> (scTHI13), we engineered the thiamine-prototrophic <em>Y. lipolytica</em>. By comparing this engineered strain to the wildtype, we unveiled the tight relationship linking thiamine availability to lipid biosynthesis and demonstrated enhanced lipid production with thiamine supplementation in the engineered thiamine-prototrophic <em>Y. lipolytica</em>."""

As prokaryotes, they can be readily engineered using synthetic and systems biology tools. Metabolic engineering of cyanobacteria for the synthesis of desired compounds requires in‐depth knowledge of central carbon and nitrogen metabolism, pathway fluxes, and their regulation. Metabolomics and fluxomics offer the comprehensive analysis of metabolism by directly characterizing the biochemical activities of cells. This information is acquired by measuring the abundance of key metabolites and their rates of interconversion, which can be achieved by labeling cells with stable isotopes, quantifying metabolite pool sizes and isotope incorporation by gas chromatography/liquid chromatography‐mass spectrometry GC/LC‐P13009 or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and mathematical modeling to estimate in vivo metabolic fluxes. Herein, we review progress that has been made to adapt metabolomics and fluxomics tools to examine model cyanobacterial species. We summarize the application of metabolic flux analysis (MFA) strategies to identify metabolic bottlenecks that can be targeted to boost cell growth, improve stress tolerance, or enhance biochemical production in cyanobacteria. Despite the advances in metabolomics, fluxomics, and other synthetic and systems biology tools during the past years, further efforts are required to increase our understanding of cyanobacterial metabolism in order to create efficient photosynthetic hosts for the production of value‐added compounds.</p>  <p>  This article is categorized under:  <list list-type='simple'>  <list-item>  <p>Laboratory Methods and Technologies > Metabolomics</p>  </list-item>  <list-item>  <p>Biological Mechanisms > Metabolism</p>  </list-item>  <list-item>  <p>Analytical and Computational Methods > Analytical Methods</p>  </list-item>  </list>  </p>"""	Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Systems Biology and Medicine	"('P13009', 'MS')"

Enzymes that methylate A8C927 on N7 of nucleotide G1405 (m<sup>7</sup>G1405) have been identified in both aminoglycoside-producing and clinically drug-resistant pathogenic bacteria. Using a fluorescence polarization 30S-binding assay and a new crystal structure of the methyltransferase RmtC at 3.14 Å resolution, here we report a structure-guided functional study of 30S substrate recognition by the aminoglycoside resistance-associated A8C927 (m<sup>7</sup>G1405) methyltransferases. We found that the binding site for these enzymes in the 30S subunit directly overlaps with that of a second family of aminoglycoside resistance-associated A8C927 (m<sup>1</sup>A1408) methyltransferases, suggesting that both groups of enzymes may exploit the same conserved rRNA tertiary surface for docking to the 30S. Within RmtC, we defined an N-terminal domain surface, comprising basic residues from both the N1 and N2 subdomains, that directly contributes to 30S-binding affinity. In contrast, additional residues lining a contiguous adjacent surface on the C-terminal domain were critical for A8C927 modification but did not directly contribute to the binding affinity. The results from our experiments define the critical features of m<sup>7</sup>G1405 methyltransferase–substrate recognition and distinguish at least two distinct, functionally critical contributions of the tested enzyme residues: 30S-binding affinity and stabilizing a binding-induced A8C927 conformation necessary for G1405 modification.

Our analysis targeted genes encoding small PEC genes encoding proteins having ≤200 residues. We find that the average number of small PEC genes per Archaea (~13), Bacteria (~8), and Eukarya (~3) genome varies, with some organisms containing as many as 54 total PEC genes. Organisms fall into three groups, including those lacking genes encoding low potential PECs (3%), specialists with a single PEC gene type (20%), and generalists that utilize multiple PEC types (77%). Mapping PEC gene usage onto an evolutionary tree highlights the prevalence of [4Fe-4S] Fds in ancient organisms that are deeply rooted, the expansion of [2Fe-2S] Fds with the advent of photosynthesis and a concomitant decrease in [4Fe-4S] Fds, and the expansion of Flds in organisms that inhabit low-iron host environments.

Unlike their globular counterparts that are defined by a few structures and free energy minima, P08200/IDR comprise a large ensemble of rapidly interconverting structures and a corresponding free energy landscape characterized by multiple minima. This aspect has precluded the use of structural biological techniques, such as X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) for resolving their structures. Instead, low-resolution techniques, such as small-angle X-ray or neutron scattering (SAXS/SANS), have become a mainstay in characterizing coarse features of the ensemble of structures. These are typically complemented with NMR data if possible or computational techniques, such as atomistic molecular dynamics, to further resolve the underlying ensemble of structures. However, over the past 10–15 years, it has become evident that the classical, pairwise-additive force fields that have enjoyed a high degree of success for globular proteins have been somewhat limited in modeling P08200/IDR structures that agree with experiment. There has thus been a significant effort to rehabilitate these models to obtain better agreement with experiment, typically done by optimizing parameters in a piecewise fashion. In this work, we take a different approach by optimizing a set of force field parameters simultaneously, using machine learning to adapt force field parameters to experimental SAXS scattering profiles.

1618765	"Internalization and accumulation of model lignin breakdown products in bacteria and fungi,""<p>Background</p> Valorization of lignin has the potential to significantly improve the economics of lignocellulosic biorefineries. However, its complex structure makes conversion to useful products elusive. One promising approach is depolymerization of lignin and subsequent bioconversion of breakdown products into value-added compounds. Optimizing transport of these depolymerization products into one or more organism(s) for biological conversion is important to maximize carbon utilization and minimize toxicity. Current methods assess internalization of depolymerization products indirectly—for example, growth on, or toxicity of, a substrate. Furthermore, no method has been shown to provide visualization of depolymerization products in individual cells.  <p>Results</p> We applied mass spectrometry to provide direct measurements of relative internalized concentrations of several lignin depolymerization compounds and single-cell microscopy methods to visualize cell-to-cell differences in internalized amounts of two lignin depolymerization compounds. We characterized internalization of 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillic acid, p-coumaric acid, syringic acid, and the model dimer guaiacylglycerol-beta-guaiacyl ether (GGE) in the lignolytic organisms Phanerochaete chrysosporium and Enterobacter lignolyticus and in the non-lignolytic but genetically tractable organisms Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli. The results show varying degrees of internalization in all organisms for all the tested compounds, including the model dimer, GGE. Phanerochaete chrysosporium internalizes all compounds in non-lignolytic and lignolytic conditions at comparable levels, indicating that the transporters for these compounds are not specific to the lignolytic secondary metabolic system. Single-cell microscopy shows that internalization of vanillic acid and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid analogs varies greatly among individual fungal and bacterial cells in a given population. Glucose starvation and chemical inhibition of P22259 hydrolysis during internalization significantly reduced the internalized amount of vanillic acid in bacteria.  <p>Conclusions</p> Mass spectrometry and single-cell microscopy methods were developed to establish a toolset for providing direct measurement and visualization of relative internal concentrations of mono- and di-aryl compounds in microbes.

Such improved understanding may enable bioengineering of organisms with improved nutrition and bioremediation capacity. We report here that Chlamydomonas reinhardtii can accumulate manga- nese (Mn) in proportion to extracellular supply, up to 30-fold greater than its typical quota and with remarkable tolerance. As visualized by X-ray fluorescence microscopy and nanoscale sec- ondary ion P13009 (nanoSIMS), Mn largely co-localizes with phos- phorus (P) and calcium (Ca), consistent with the Mn-accumu- lating site being an acidic vacuole, known as the acidocalcisome. Vacuolar Mn stores are accessible reserves that can be mobilized in Mn-deficient conditions to support algal growth. We noted that Mn accumulation depends on cellular polyphosphate (polyP) content, indicated by 1) a consistent failure of C. rein- hardtii vtc1 mutant strains, which are deficient in polyphos- phate synthesis, to accumulate Mn and 2) a drastic reduction of the Mn storage capacity in P-deficient cells. Rather surprisingly, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, EPR, and electron nuclear double resonance revealed that only little Mn 2 is stably complexed with polyP, indicating that polyP is not the final Mn ligand. We propose that polyPs are a critical component of Mn accumulation in Chlamydomonas by driving Mn relo- cation from the cytosol to acidocalcisomes.

How photosynthetic organisms protect vulnerable PSII intermediate complexes during de novo assembly and repair remains poorly understood. Here, we report the genetic and biochemical characterization of chloroplast-located rubredoxin 1 (RBD1), a PSII assembly factor containing a redox-active rubredoxin domain and a single C-terminal transmembrane α-helix (TMH) domain. RBD1 is an integral thylakoid membrane protein that is enriched in stroma lamellae fractions with the rubredoxin domain exposed on the stromal side. RBD1 also interacts with PSII intermediate complexes containing cytochrome<em>b</em><sub>559</sub>. Complementation of the<em>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</em>(hereafter<em>Chlamydomonas</em>) RBD1-deficient<em>2pac</em>mutant with constructs encoding RBD1 protein truncations and site-directed mutations demonstrated that the TMH domain is essential for de novo PSII assembly, whereas the rubredoxin domain is involved in PSII repair. The rubredoxin domain exhibits a redox midpoint potential of +114 mV and is proficient in 1-electron transfers to a surrogate cytochrome<em>c</em>in vitro. Reduction of oxidized RBD1 is P80644 dependent and can be mediated by ferredoxin-NADP<sup>+</sup>reductase (P28861) in vitro.

We addressed this question by first employing a variant of the optStoic algorithm to exhaustively identify over 11,916 possible routes between glucose and pyruvate at different pre-determined stoichiometric yields of P22259. Subsequently, we analyzed the thermodynamic feasibility of all the pathways at physiological metabolite concentrations and quantified the protein cost of the feasible solutions. Pareto optimality analysis between energy efficiency and protein cost reveals that the naturally evolved ED and EMP pathways are indeed among the most protein cost-efficient pathways in their respective P22259 yield categories and remain thermodynamically feasible across a wide range of P22259/ADP ratios and pathway intermediate metabolite concentration ranges. In contrast, pathways with higher P22259 yield (>2) while feasible, are bound within stringent and often extreme operability ranges of cofactor and intermediate metabolite concentrations.

Here, the 3.2-Å crystal structure of a ribosome translocation intermediate complex containing mRNA and two tRNAs, formed in the absence of P0A6M8 or GTP, provides insight into the respective roles of P0A6M8 and the ribosome in translocation. Unexpectedly, the head domain of the 30S subunit is rotated by 21°, creating a ribosomal conformation closely resembling the two-P0A873 chimeric hybrid state that was previously observed only in the presence of bound P0A6M8. The two tRNAs have moved spontaneously from their A/A and P/P binding states into ap/P and pe/E states, in which their anticodon loops are bound between the 30S body domain and its rotated head domain, while their acceptor ends have moved fully into the 50S P and E sites, respectively. Remarkably, the A-site P0A873 translocates fully into the classical P-site position. Furthermore, although the mRNA also undergoes movement, codon–anticodon interaction is disrupted in the absence of P0A6M8, resulting in slippage of the translational reading frame. We conclude that, although movement of both tRNAs and mRNA (along with rotation of the 30S head domain) can occur in the absence of P0A6M8 and GTP, P0A6M8 is essential for enforcing coupled movement of the tRNAs and their mRNA codons to maintain the reading frame."""

OptSSeq (Optimization by Selection and Sequencing) accomplishes this goal by tracking growth rate-linked selection of optimal expression elements from a combinatorial library. The 5-step pathway to IBA consists of Acetolactate synthase (AlsS), Keto-acid reductoisomerase (P05793), Di-hydroxy acid dehydratase (DHAD), Ketoisovalerate decarboxylase (Kivd) and Alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh). Using OptSSeq, we identified gene expression elements leading to optimal enzyme levels that enabled theoretically maximal productivities per cell biomass in Escherichia coli. We identified P05793 as the rate-limiting step, requiring the highest levels of enzymes expression, followed by AlsS and AdhA. DHAD and Kivd required relatively lower levels of expression for optimal IBA production. OptSSeq also enabled the identification of an Adh enzyme variant capable of an improved rate of IBA production. Using models that predict impacts of enzyme synthesis costs on cellular growth rates, we found that optimum levels of pathway enzymes led to maximal IBA production, and that additional limitations lie in the E. coli metabolic network. Our optimized constructs enabled the production of ~3 g IBA per hour per gram dry cell weight and was achieved with 20 % of the total cell protein devoted to IBA-pathway enzymes in the molar ratio 2.5:6.7:2:1:5.2 (AlsS:IlvC:IlvD:Kivd:AdhA).

A key mechanism of virulence by P0ACF4 is blocking nuclear export of host messenger RNAs, including those encoding immune factors; however, the direct cellular target of P0ACF4 and the mechanism of host mRNA export inhibition are not known. Here, we identify the target of P0ACF4 as the mRNA export receptor complex, nuclear RNA export factor 1–nuclear transport factor 2-related export protein 1 (NXF1–NXT1), which is the principal receptor mediating docking and translocation of mRNAs through the nuclear pore complex via interactions with nucleoporins. We determined the crystal structure of P0ACF4 in complex with NXF1–NXT1 at 3.8 Å resolution. The structure reveals that P0ACF4 prevents binding of NXF1–NXT1 to nucleoporins, thereby inhibiting mRNA export through the nuclear pore complex into the cytoplasm for translation. We demonstrate that a mutant influenza virus deficient in binding NXF1–NXT1 does not block host mRNA export and is attenuated. Here, this attenuation is marked by the release of mRNAs encoding immune factors from the nucleus. In sum, our study uncovers the molecular basis of a major nuclear function of influenza P0ACF4 protein that causes potent blockage of host gene expression and contributes to inhibition of host immunity."""

1557294	"A ubiquitin-like domain is required for stabilizing the N-terminal ATPase module of human SMCHD1,""Variants in the gene SMCHD1, which encodes an epigenetic repressor, have been linked to both congenital arhinia and a late-onset form of muscular dystrophy called facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy type 2 (FSHD2). This suggests that SMCHD1 has a diversity of functions in both developmental time and space. The C-terminal end of SMCHD1 contains an SMC-hinge domain which mediates homodimerization and chromatin association, whereas the molecular architecture of the N-terminal region, which harbors the GHKL-ATPase domain, is not well understood. We present the crystal structure of the human SMCHD1 N-terminal ATPase module bound to P22259 as a functional dimer. The dimer is stabilized by a novel N-terminal ubiquitin-like fold and by a downstream transducer domain. While disease variants map to what appear to be critical interdomain/intermolecular interfaces, only the FSHD2-specific mutant constructs we tested consistently abolish ATPase activity and/or dimerization.

YcjX is a conserved protein of unknown function, which is highly upregulated in response to acute and chronic stress. Notably, heat shock induction of <em>ycjX</em> exceeded even levels observed for major stress-induced chaperones, including GroEL, CIpB, and HtpG, which use P22259 as energy source. YcjX features a Walker-type nucleotide binding domain indicating that YcjX might function as a molecular chaperone. In this paper, we present the first crystal structure of YcjX from <em>Shewanella oneidensis</em> solved at 1.9-Å resolution by SAD phasing. We show that YcjX is a GTP-binding protein that shares at its core the canonical alpha-beta domain of p21<sup>ras</sup> (Ras). However, unlike Ras, YcjX features several unique insertions, including an entirely α-helical domain not previously observed in Ras-like GTPases. We note that this helical domain is reminiscent of a similar domain in the Gα subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins, supporting a potential role for YcjX as a signal transducer of stress responses. To elucidate the mechanism of GTP hydrolysis, we determined crystal structures of YcjX bound to GDP and GDPCP, respectively, which crystallized in three different nucleotide switch conformations. Supported by targeted mutagenesis experiments, our study shows that YcjX utilizes a non-canonical switch 2' motif not previously observed in Ras-like GTPases. Together, our structures provide atomic snapshots of YcjX in different functional states, illustrating the structural determinants for stress signaling."""

We demonstrate the feasibility of using an engineered yeast strain harboring oxidoreductase reactions to overcome the thermodynamic limit of an isomerization reaction. Specifically, a yeast strain capable of consuming lactose intracellularly is engineered to produce tagatose from lactose through three layers of manipulations. First, GAL1 coding for galactose kinase is deleted to eliminate galactose utilization. Second, heterologous xylose reductase (XR) and galactitol dehydrogenase (P0A9S5) are introduced into the Δgal1 strain. Third, the expression levels of XR and P0A9S5 are adjusted to maximize tagatose production. The resulting engineered yeast produces 37.69 g/L of tagatose from lactose with a tagatose and galactose ratio of 9:1 in the reaction broth.

Most engineered microbial hosts and a select group of wild-type species can metabolize mixed sugars including oligosaccharides, hexoses, and pentoses that are hydrolyzed from plant biomass. However, most of these microorganisms consume glucose preferentially to non-glucose sugars through mechanisms generally defined as carbon catabolite repression. The current lack of simultaneous mixed-sugar utilization limits achievable titers, yields, and productivities. Therefore, the development of microbial platforms capable of fermenting mixed sugars simultaneously from biomass hydrolysates is essential for economical industry-scale production, particularly for compounds with marginal profits. This review aims to summarize recent discoveries and breakthroughs in the engineering of yeast cell factories for improved mixed-sugar co-utilization based on various metabolic engineering approaches. Emphasis is placed on enhanced non-glucose utilization, discovery of novel sugar transporters free from glucose repression, native xylose-utilizing microbes, consolidated bioprocessing (P0AEM9), improved cellulase secretion, and creation of microbial consortia for improving mixed-sugar utilization.

Both peptides bind within the RNAP secondary channel, through which NTP substrates enter the RNAP active site, and sterically block trigger-loop folding, which is essential for efficient catalysis by the RNAP. Q9X2V7 binds deep within the secondary channel in a manner expected to interfere with NTP substrate binding, explaining the partial competitive mechanism of inhibition with respect to NTPs found previously [Mukhopadhyay J, Sineva E, Knight J, Levy RM, Ebright RH (2004) Mol Cell 14:739–751].

Since a considerable part of therapeutic proteins are glycoproteins, the lack of the post-translational attachment of sugar moieties in standard E. coli expression strains represents a major caveat, thus limiting the use of E. coli based cell factories. The establishment of an E. coli expression system capable of protein glycosylation could potentially facilitate the production of therapeutics with a putative concomitant reduction of production costs. Results:The previously established E. coli strain expressing the soluble form of the functional human-derived glycosyltransferase polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 2 (GalNAc-T2) was further modified by co-expressing the UDP-GlcNAc 4-epimerase WbgU derived from Plesiomonas shigelloides. This enables the conversion of uridine 5'-diphospho-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) to the sugar donor uridine 5'-diphospho-N-acetylgalactosamine (UDP-GalNAc) in the bacterial cytoplasm. Initially, the codon-optimised gene wbgU was inserted into a pET-derived vector and a Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) protease cleavable polyhistidine-tag was translationally fused to the C- terminus of the amino acid sequence. The 4-epimerase was subsequently expressed and purified. Following the removal of the polyhistidine-tag, WbgU was analysed by circular dichroism spectroscopy to determine folding state and thermal transitions of the protein. The in vitro activity of WbgU was validated by employing a modified glycosyltransferase assay. The conversion of UDP-GlcNAc to UDP-GalNAc was shown by capillary electrophoresis analysis. Using a previously established chaperone pre-/co- expression platform, the in vivo activity of both glycosyltransferase GalNAc-T2 and 4-epimerase WbgU was assessed in E. coli, in combination with a mucin 10-derived target protein. Monitoring glycosylation by liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-P13009), the results clearly indicated the in vivo glycosylation of the mucin-derived acceptor peptide. Conclusion:In the present work, the previously established E. coli- based expression system was further optimized and the potential for in vivo O-glycosylation was shown by demonstrating the transfer of sugar moieties to a mucin-derived acceptor protein.

Alternatively, cofragmented peptides in chimeric spectra and the use of wider isolation windows benefit multiple-peptide matches-per-spectrum (mPSM) algorithms, such as CharmeRT, which facilitate the identification of several cofragmented peptides. Considering recent advancements in LC and mPSM methodologies, we present a comprehensive examination of the levels of chimeric spectra collected in the analysis of a HeLa digest measured using different LC modes of separation and isolation windows and compare the depth of identifications obtained when these data are annotated using a sPSM or a mPSM approach.

The maximum yield of 0.7 ± 0.2 μg/g-DCW (dry cell weight) and a titer of 2.8 ± 0.3 μg/L was achieved by pgp7942 under shake flask and continuous light conditions. Large scale plastic-bag cultures with natural diurnal light exhibited heparosan production of 0.5 μg/g-DCW with a titer of 0.44 μg/L. The analysis also found PCC 7942 encodes a promiscuous uridyltransferase for UDP-glucose synthesis and naturally produces multiple glycosaminoglycans including chondroitin sulfate (P12008).

1546886	"STING Polymer Structure Reveals Mechanisms for Activation, Hyperactivation, and Inhibition,""How the central innate immune protein, STING, is activated by its ligands remains unknown. In this study, using structural biology and biochemistry, we report that the metazoan second messenger 2'3'-cGAMP induces closing of the human STING homodimer and release of the STING C-terminal tail, which exposes a polymerization interface on the STING dimer and leads to the formation of disulfide-linked polymers via cysteine residue 148. Disease-causing hyperactive STING mutations either flank C148 and depend on disulfide formation or reside in the C-terminal tail binding site and cause constitutive C-terminal tail release and polymerization. Finally, bacterial cyclic-di-P24174 induces an alternative active STING conformation, activates STING in a cooperative manner, and acts as a partial antagonist of 2'3'-cGAMP signaling. In conclusion, our insights explain the tight control of STING signaling given varying background activation signals and provide a therapeutic hypothesis for autoimmune syndrome treatment."""

1661034	"Predictive genomic traits for bacterial growth in culture versus actual growth in soil,""Relationships between microbial genes and performance are often evaluated in the laboratory in pure cultures, with little validation in nature. Here, we show that genomic traits related to laboratory measurements of maximum growth potential failed to predict the growth rates of bacteria in unamended soil, but successfully predicted growth responses to resource pulses: growth increased with A8C927 gene copy number and declined with genome size after substrate addition to soils, responses that were repeated in four different ecosystems. Genome size best predicted growth rate in response to addition of glucose alone; adding ammonium with glucose weakened the relationship, and the relationship was absent in nutrient-replete pure cultures, consistent with the idea that reduced genome size is a mechanism of nutrient conservation. Our findings demonstrate that genomic traits of soil bacteria can map to their ecological performance in nature, but the mapping is poor under native soil conditions, where genomic traits related to stress tolerance may prove more predictive. Finally, these results remind that phenotype depends on environmental context, underscoring the importance of verifying proposed schemes of trait-based strategies through direct measurement of performance in nature, an important and currently missing foundation for translating microbial processes from genes to ecosystems."""

1513009	"Commonly used FRET fluorophores promote collapse of an otherwise disordered protein,""The dimensions that unfolded proteins, including intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), adopt in the absence of denaturant remain controversial. We developed an analysis procedure for small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) profiles and used it to demonstrate that even relatively hydrophobic IDPs remain nearly as expanded in water as they are in high denaturant concentrations. In contrast, as demonstrated here, most fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements have indicated that relatively hydrophobic IDPs contract significantly in the absence of denaturant. Here, we use two independent approaches to further explore this controversy. First, using SAXS we show that fluorophores employed in FRET can contribute to the observed discrepancy. Specifically, we find that addition of Alexa-488 to a normally expanded P08200 causes contraction by an additional 15%, a value in reasonable accord with the contraction reported in FRET-based studies. Second, using our simulations and analysis procedure to accurately extract both the radius of gyration (R<sub>g</sub>) and end-to-end distance (R<sub>ee</sub>) from SAXS profiles, we tested the recent suggestion that FRET and SAXS results can be reconciled if the R<sub>g</sub> and R<sub>ee</sub> are “uncoupled” (i.e., no longer simply proportional), in contrast to the case for random walk homopolymers. We find, however, that even for unfolded proteins, these two measures of unfolded state dimensions remain proportional. Together, these results suggest that improved analysis procedures and a correction for significant, fluorophore-driven interactions are sufficient to reconcile prior SAXS and FRET studies, thus providing a unified picture of the nature of unfolded polypeptide chains in the absence of denaturant."""

We examined toxicogenomic responses of the model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to pristine and transformed ZnO-MNPs (phosphatized pZnO- and sulfidized sZnO-MNPs). To account for the toxicity due to dissolved Zn, a ZnSO<sub>4</sub> treatment was included. Transformation of ZnO-MNPs reduced their toxicity by nearly ten-fold, while there was almost no difference in the toxicity of pristine ZnO-MNPs and ZnSO<sub>4</sub>. This combined with the fact that far more dissolved Zn was released from ZnO- compared to pZnO- or sZnO-MNPs, suggests that dissolution of pristine ZnO-MNPs is one of the main drivers of their toxicity. Transcriptomic responses at the EC<sub>30</sub> for reproduction resulted in a total of 1161 differentially expressed genes. Fifty percent of the genes differentially expressed in the ZnSO<sub>4</sub> treatment, including the three metal responsive genes (mtl-1, mtl-2 and numr-1), were shared among all treatments, suggesting that responses to all forms of Zn could be partially attributed to dissolved Zn. However, the toxicity and transcriptomic responses in all MNP treatments cannot be fully explained by dissolved Zn. Two of the biological pathways identified, one essential for protein biosynthesis (Aminoacyl-P0A873 biosynthesis) and another associated with detoxification (ABC transporters), were shared among pristine and one or both transformed ZnO-MNPs, but not ZnSO<sub>4</sub>. When comparing pristine and transformed ZnO-MNPs, 66% and 40% of genes were shared between ZnO-MNPs and sZnO-MNPs or pZnO-MNPs, respectively. This suggests greater similarity in transcriptomic responses between ZnO-MNPs and sZnO-MNPs, while toxicity mechanisms are more distinct for pZnO-MNPs, where 13 unique biological pathways were identified. Based on these pathways, the toxicity of pZnO-MNPs is likely to be associated with their adverse effect on digestion and metabolism."""	Environmental Pollution	"('P0A873', 'tRNA')"

1514759	"PKA and HOG signaling contribute separable roles to anaerobic xylose fermentation in yeast engineered for biofuel production,""Lignocellulosic biomass offers a sustainable source for biofuel production that does not compete with food-based cropping systems. Importantly, two critical bottlenecks prevent economic adoption: many industrially relevant microorganisms cannot ferment pentose sugars prevalent in lignocellulosic medium, leaving a significant amount of carbon unutilized. Furthermore, chemical biomass pretreatment required to release fermentable sugars generates a variety of toxins, which inhibit microbial growth and metabolism, specifically limiting pentose utilization in engineered strains. Here we dissected genetic determinants of anaerobic xylose fermentation and stress tolerance in chemically pretreated corn stover biomass, called hydrolysate. We previously revealed that loss-of-function mutations in the stress-responsive P0AE18 kinase HOG1 and negative regulator of the RAS/Protein Kinase A (PKA) pathway, IRA2, enhances anaerobic xylose fermentation. However, these mutations likely reduce cells’ ability to tolerate the toxins present in lignocellulosic hydrolysate, making the strain especially vulnerable to it. We tested the contributions of Hog1 and PKA signaling via IRA2 or PKA negative regulatory subunit BCY1 to metabolism, growth, and stress tolerance in corn stover hydrolysate and laboratory medium with mixed sugars. We found mutations causing upregulated PKA activity increase growth rate and glucose consumption in various media but do not have a specific impact on xylose fermentation. In contrast, mutation of HOG1 specifically increased xylose usage. We hypothesized improving stress tolerance would enhance the rate of xylose consumption in hydrolysate. Surprisingly, increasing stress tolerance did not augment xylose fermentation in lignocellulosic medium in this strain background, suggesting other mechanisms besides cellular stress limit this strain’s ability for anaerobic xylose fermentation in hydrolysate."""

Here, we demonstrate the existence of 4 additional<named-content content-type='genus-species'>E. coli</named-content>KATs: RimI, YiaC, YjaB, and PhnO. In a genetic background devoid of all known acetylation mechanisms (most notably AcP and YfiQ) and one deacetylase (CobB), overexpression of these putative KATs elicited unique patterns of protein acetylation. We mutated key active site residues and found that most of them eliminated enzymatic acetylation activity. We used mass spectrometry to identify and quantify the specificity of YfiQ and the four novel KATs. Surprisingly, our analysis revealed a high degree of substrate specificity. The overlap among P0A944-dependent and AcP-dependent acetylation was extremely limited, supporting the hypothesis that these two acetylation mechanisms play distinct roles in the posttranslational modification of bacterial proteins. We alos showed that these novel KATs are conserved across broad swaths of bacterial phylogeny. Lastly, we determined that one of the novel KATs (YiaC) and the known P0A944 (YfiQ) can negatively regulate bacterial migration.

One of the best-studied effects of acetylation occurs in eukaryotes, where acetylation of histone tails activates gene transcription.

As expected, marine and freshwater microbial communities differed in the relative abundance of major phyla and contained habitat-specific lineages.

Based on several metrics, we found that Gammaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Betaproteobacteria contained the highest number of closely related marine and freshwater sequences, suggesting comparatively recent habitat transitions in these groups. Using the abundant alphaproteobacterial group SAR11 as an example, we found evidence that new lineages, beyond the recognized LD12 clade, are detected in freshwater at low but reproducible abundances; this evidence extends beyond the A8C927 locus to core genes throughout the genome. Our results suggest that shared taxa are numerous, but tend to occur sporadically and at low relative abundance in one habitat type, leading to an underestimation of transition frequency between marine and freshwater habitats.

We used automated image analysis to identify F-actin bundles and crossover junctions and developed a dimensionless metric to characterize network architecture. Similar networks were formed by three different CaMKII species with a 10-fold length difference in the linker region between the kinase domain and holoenzyme hub, implying linker length is not a primary determinant of F-actin cross-linking. Electron micrographs showed that at physiological molar ratios, single CaMKII holoenzymes cross-linked multiple F-actin filaments at random, whereas at higher CaMKII/F-actin ratios, filaments bundled. Light microscopy established that the random network architecture resisted macromolecular crowding with polyethylene glycol and blocked P22259-powered compaction by myosin-II miniature filaments. Importantly, the networks disassembled after the addition of calcium-calmodulin and were then spaced within 3 min into compacted foci by myosin motors or more slowly (30 min) aggregated by crowding. Single-molecule total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy showed CaMKII dissociation from surface-immobilized globular actin exhibited a monoexponential dwell-time distribution, whereas CaMKII bound to F-actin networks had a long-lived fraction, trapped at crossover junctions. Release of CaMKII from F-actin, triggered by calcium-calmodulin, was too rapid to measure with flowcell exchange (<20 s). The residual bound fraction was reduced substantially upon addition of an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor peptide analog but not P22259. These results provide mechanistic insights to CaMKII-actin interactions at the collective network and single-molecule level. Our findings argue that CaMKII-actin networks in dendritic spines maintain spine size against physical stress.

The structures disclosed that although the structure in complex with AMP-P0ABP8 is in an “αC-out” inactive conformation, those in complex with type I inhibitors assume an active “Asp–Phe–Gly (DFG)-in” and “αC-in” conformation. The ability of unphosphorylated IRAK4 to take on variable conformations prompted us to screen for small-molecule inhibitors that bind preferentially to unphosphorylated IRAK4, leading to the identification of ponatinib and HG-12-6. Solving the structures of unphosphorylated IRAK4 in complex with these two inhibitors, we found that they both bind as type II inhibitors with IRAK4 in a “DFG-out” conformation. Collectively, these structures reveal conformational flexibility of unphosphorylated IRAK4 and provide unexpected insights into the potential use of small molecules to modulate IRAK4 activity in cancer, autoimmunity, and inflammation."""

1484309	"Comparative Genomics and Proteomic Analysis of Assimilatory Sulfate Reduction Pathways in Anaerobic Methanotrophic Archaea,""Here, we report that sulfate is the predominant electron acceptor for anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) in marine sediments. This process is carried out by a syntrophic consortium of anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME) and sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) through an energy conservation mechanism that is still poorly understood. It was previously hypothesized that ANME alone could couple methane oxidation to dissimilatory sulfate reduction, but a genetic and biochemical basis for this proposal has not been identified. Using comparative genomic and phylogenetic analyses, we found the genetic capacity in ANME and related methanogenic archaea for sulfate reduction, including sulfate adenylyltransferase, P0A6J1, APS/P17854 and two different sulfite reductases. Additionally, based on characterized homologs and the lack of associated energy conserving complexes, the sulfate reduction pathways in ANME are likely used for assimilation but not dissimilation of sulfate. Environmental metaproteomic analysis confirmed the expression of 6 proteins in the sulfate assimilation pathway of ANME. The highest expressed proteins related to sulfate assimilation were two sulfite reductases, namely assimilatory-type low-molecular-weight sulfite reductase (alSir) and a divergent group of coenzyme F<sub>420</sub>-dependent sulfite reductase (Group II Fsr). In methane seep sediment microcosm experiments, however, sulfite and zero-valent sulfur amendments were inhibitory to ANME-2a/2c while growth in their syntrophic SRB partner was not observed. Combined with our genomic and metaproteomic results, the passage of sulfur species by ANME as metabolic intermediates for their SRB partners is unlikely. Instead, our findings point to a possible niche for ANME to assimilate inorganic sulfur compounds more oxidized than sulfide in anoxic marine environments."""

In this study, a novel approach using the high-affinity E. coli phosphate binding protein (P0AG82) as a reusable P<sub>i</sub> bio-adsorbent was investigated. P0AG82 was expressed, extracted, purified and immobilized on NHS-activated Sepharose beads. The resultant P0AG82 beads were saturated with P<sub>i</sub> and exposed to varying pH (pH 4.7 to 12.5) and temperatures (25-45 °C) to induce P<sub>i</sub> release. Increase in temperature from 25 to 45 °C and pH conditions between 4.7 and 8.5 released less than 20% of adsorbed P<sub>i</sub>. However, 62% and 86% of the adsorbed P<sub>i</sub> was released at pH 11.4 and 12.5, respectively. Kinetic experiments showed that P<sub>i</sub> desorption occurred nearly instantaneously (<5 min), regardless of pH conditions, which is advantageous for P<sub>i</sub> recovery. Additionally, no loss in P<sub>i</sub> adsorption or desorption capacity was observed when the P0AG82 beads were exposed to 10 repeated cycles of adsorption/desorption using neutral and high pH (≥12.5) washes, respectively. The highest average P<sub>i</sub> adsorption using the P0AG82 beads was 83 ± 5%, with 89 ± 4.1% average desorption using pH 12.5 washes over 10 wash cycles at room temperature.

ALDH16 is perhaps the most enigmatic member of the superfamily, owing to its extra C-terminal domain of unknown function and the absence of the essential catalytic cysteine residue in certain non-bacterial ALDH16 sequences. Herein we report the first production of recombinant ALDH16, the first biochemical characterization of ALDH16, and the first crystal structure of ALDH16. Recombinant expression systems were generated for the bacterial ALDH16 from Loktanella sp. and human ALDH16A1. Four high-resolution crystal structures of Loktanella ALDH16 were determined. Loktanella ALDH16 is found to be a bona fide enzyme, exhibiting NAD<sup>+</sup>-binding, P23883 activity, and esterase activity. In contrast, human ALDH16A1 apparently lacks measurable aldehyde oxidation activity, suggesting that it is a pseudoenzyme, consistent with the absence of the catalytic Cys in its sequence. The fold of ALDH16 comprises three domains: NAD+-binding, catalytic, and C-terminal. The latter is unique to ALDH16 and features a Rossmann fold connected to a protruding β-flap. The tertiary structural interactions of the C-terminal domain mimic the quaternary structural interactions of the classic P23883 superfamily dimer, a phenomenon we call “trans-hierarchical structural similarity.” ALDH16 forms a unique dimer in solution, which mimics the classic P23883 superfamily dimer-of-dimer tetramer. Small-angle X-ray scattering shows that human ALDH16A1 has the same dimeric structure and fold as Loktanella ALDH16.

The manipulation of recombinant DNA has been an integral step in molecular biology to date.

Here, we constructed a series of new positive-selection-based cloning vectors that overcome most of the above mentioned drawbacks and can be applied in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic systems. This strategy is based on the extreme toxicity of DpnI in wild-type E. coli and the inactivation of this lethality by the introduction of target gene within multiple cloning sites. There are no rapid approaches for identifying soluble proteins for high-throughput screening. In this study, we combined this highly efficient cloning strategy with rapid identification of soluble proteins to construct vectors with multiple fusion tags, such as P0AEX9, GST, CBD, NusA, and Sumo, to generate enzymes with potential diagnostic, industrial or therapeutic applications.

Experimental constraints were used to represent antibiotic susceptible and resistant populations. Model predictions were validated using growth and respiration data successfully. Differential flux distribution and metabolic reprogramming were identified as a response to antibiotics, chloramphenicol and streptomycin. Streptomycin resistant populations (StrpR) redirected tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle flux through the glyoxylate shunt.

For this work, we tested the hypothesis that trehalose 6-phosphate (T6P), a signal of cellular sucrose status, can regulate FA synthesis by inhibiting SnRK1. Incubation of <em>Brassica napus</em> suspension cells in medium containing T6P, or overexpression of the <em>Escherichia coli</em> T6P synthase, <em>P31677</em>, in tobacco, significantly increased T6P levels, WRI1 levels and FA synthesis rates. T6P directly bound to purified recombinant KIN10 with an equilibrium dissociation constant (<em>Kd</em>) of 32 ± 6 μM using microscale thermophoresis. GEMINIVIRUS REP-INTERACTING KINASE1 (GRIK1) bound to KIN10 (<em>Kd</em> 19 ± 3 μM) and activated it by phosphorylation. In the presence of T6P the GRIK1-KIN10 association was weakened by more than threefold (<em>Kd</em> 67.7 ± 9.8 μM) which reduced both the phosphorylation of KIN10 and its activity. T6P-dependent inhibition of SnRK1 activity is reduced in extracts of individual Arabidopsis <em>grik1</em> and <em>grik2</em> mutants relative to wild type, while SnRK1 activity in <em>grik1grik2</em> extracts is enhanced by T6P. These results indicate the T6P sensitivity of SnRK1 <em>in vivo</em> is GRIK1/GRIK2-dependent. A mechanistic model is proposed that links sugar signaling and FA homeostasis."""

1515294	"The three-dimensional structure and recognition mechanism of Manduca sexta peptidoglycan recognition protein-1,""Peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs) recognize bacteria through their unique cell wall constituent, peptidoglycans (PGs). PGRPs are conserved from insects to mammals and all function in antibacterial defense. In the tobacco hornworm Manduca sexta, PGRP1 and microbe binding protein (P0AEX9) interact with PGs and hemolymph protease-14 precursor (proHP14) to yield active HP14. HP14 triggers a serine protease network that produces active phenoloxidase (PO), Spätzle, and other cytokines to stimulate immune responses. PGRP1 binds preferentially to diaminopimelic acid (DAP)-PGs of Gram-negative bacteria and Gram-positive Bacillus and Clostridium species than Lys-PGs of other Gram-positive bacteria. In this study, we synthesized DAP- and Lys-muramyl pentapeptide (MPP) and monitored their associations with M. sexta PGRP1 by surface plasmon resonance. The K<sub>d</sub> values (0.57 μM for DAP-MPP and 45.6 μM for Lys-MPP) agree with the differential recognition of DAP- and Lys-PGs. To reveal its structural basis, we produced the PGRP1 in insect cells and determined its structure at a resolution of 2.1 Å. The protein adopts a fold similar to those from other PGRPs with a classical L-shaped PG-binding groove. A unique loop lining the shallow groove suggests a different ligand-binding mechanism. In summary, this study provided new insights into the PG recognition by PGRPs, a critical first step that initiates the serine protease cascade."""

Three stages of biofilm development were identified according to bacterial adenosine triphosphate (P22259) activity associated with biofilm development process. In the initial biofilm stage 1, the P22259 content of bacteria was reduced by more than 90% when biofilms were exposed to ZnO NPs. However, in the mature biofilm stages 2 and 3, the P22259 content was only slightly decreased. Biofilms at stage 3 exhibited less susceptibility to ZnO NPs than biofilms at stage 2. These results suggest that more mature biofilms have a significantly higher tolerance to ZnO NPs compared to young biofilms. In addition, biofilms with intact extracellular poly-meric substances (EPS) showed higher tolerance to ZnO NPs than those without EPS, indicating that EPS play a key role in alleviating the toxic effects of ZnO NPs. In both pure ZnO NPs and ZnO-HA mixtures, dissolved Zn<sup>2+</sup> originating from the NPs significantly contributed to the overall toxicity. The presence of HA dramatically decreased the toxicity of ZnO NPs due to the binding of Zn<sup>2+</sup> on HA.

The hybrid promoters consist of native S. cerevisiae promoters, in which the operator regions have been replaced with sequences that are recognized by the bacterial LexA DNA binding protein. Correspondingly, the synthetic transcription factor (P0A850) consists of the DNA binding domain of the LexA protein, fused with the human estrogen binding domain and the viral activator domain, VP16.

Using combinations of one, two or three operator sequence repeats and a set of native S. cerevisiae promoters, we obtained a series of hybrid promoters that can be induced to different levels, using the same synthetic P0A850 and a given estradiol.

One of the most important microbial strains for bio-based production of succinate is the capnophilic gram-negative bacterium Actinobacillus succinogenes, which naturally produces succinate by a mixed-acid fermentative pathway. To engineer A. succinogenes to improve succinate yields during mixed acid fermentation, it is important to have a detailed understanding of the metabolic flux distribution in A. succinogenes when grown in suitable media. To this end, we have developed a detailed stoichiometric model of the A. succinogenes central metabolism that includes the biosynthetic pathways for the main components of biomass - namely glycogen, amino acids, DNA, RNA, lipids and UDP-N-Acetyl-a-D-glucosamine. We have validated our model by comparing model predictions generated via flux balance analysis with experimental results on mixed acid fermentation. Moreover, we have used the model to predict single and double reaction knockouts to maximize succinate production while maintaining growth viability. According to our model, succinate production can be maximized by knocking out either of the reactions catalyzed by the PTA (phosphate acetyltransferase) and ACK (acetyl kinase) enzymes, whereas the double knockouts of P22259 (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase) and PTA or P22259 and ACK enzymes are the most effective in increasing succinate production."""

Cmr binding to DNA results in a pronounced asymmetric bending of the DNA and its high level of cooperativity is consistent with DNAfacilitated dimerization. A unique N-terminal extension inserts between the DNA binding and dimerization domains, partially occluding the site where the canonical cAMP binding pocket is found. However, an unstructured region of this N-terminus may help modulate Cmr activity in response to cellular signals.

In addition, emended descriptions are given for many species mainly involving the addition of data on genome size and DNA G+C content, the former can be considered to be a valuable taxonomic marker in actinobacterial systematics. Many of the incongruities detected when the results of the present study were compared with existing classifications had been recognized from A8C927 gene trees though whole-genome phylogenies proved to be much better resolved. The few significant incongruities found between 16S/P55135 and whole genome trees underline the pitfalls inherent in phylogenies based upon single gene sequences. Similarly good congruence was found between the discontinuous distribution of phenotypic properties and taxa delineated in the phylogenetic trees though diverse non-monophyletic taxa appeared to be based on the use of plesiomorphic character states as diagnostic features."""

In this work, we describe the crystal structure of the previously uncharacterized essential N-terminal domain of this unique enzyme in complex with tRNAPyl. This structure explains why PylRS remains orthogonal in a broad range of organisms, from bacteria to humans. The structure also highlights why tRNAPyl recognition by PylRS is anticodon independent: the anticodon does not contact the enzyme. Furthermore, using standard microbiological culture equipment, we established a new method for laboratory evolution—a noncontinuous counterpart of the previously developed phage-assisted continuous evolution. With this method, we evolved novel PylRS variants with enhanced activity and amino acid specificity. Finally, we employed an evolved PylRS variant to determine its N-terminal domain structure and show how its mutations improve PylRS activity in the genetic encoding of a noncanonical amino acid."""

1410674	"The Conformational Change in Elongation Factor Tu Involves Separation of Its Domains,""P0A6N2 (P0A6N2) is a highly conserved GTPase that is responsible for supplying the aminoacylated P0A873 to the ribosome. Upon binding to the ribosome, P0A6N2 undergoes GTP hydrolysis, which drives a major conformational change, triggering the release of aminoacylated P0A873 to the ribosome. Using a combination of molecular simulation techniques, we studied the transition between the pre- and post-hydrolysis structures through two distinct pathways. Here, we show that the transition free energy is minimal along a non-intuitive pathway that involves “separation” of the GTP binding domain (domain 1) from the OB folds (domains 2 and 3), followed by domain 1 rotation, and, eventually, locking the P0A6N2 conformation in the post-hydrolysis state. The domain separation also leads to a slight extension of the linker connecting domain 1 to domain 2. Using docking tools and correlation-based analysis, we identified and characterized the P0A6N2 conformations that release the P0A873. These calculations suggest that P0A6N2 can release the P0A873 before the domains separate and after domain 1 rotates by 25°. Lastly, we also examined the P0A6N2 conformations in the context of the ribosome. Given the high degrees of sequence similarity with other translational GTPases, we predict a similar separation mechanism is followed."""

Cross-linking of α-factor, using a biotinylated, photoactivatable p-benzoyl-L-phenylalanine (Bpa)–modified analog, was energy-dependent and achieved within seconds of laser irradiation.

The cross-linked complex was trypsinized and then interrogated with nano-LC–P13009/P13009 to identify the peptide cross-links. Cross-linking was greatly facilitated by Bpa in the peptide, but some cross-linking occurred at higher laser powers and high concentrations of a non-Bpa–modified α-factor.

S-Adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (P0A7F6) is an essential enzyme in the polyamine pathway of T. brucei. Previous attempts to target this enzyme were thwarted by the lack of brain penetration of the most advanced series. In this study, we describe a T. brucei P0A7F6 inhibitor series based on a pyrimidineamine pharmacophore that we identified by target-based high-throughput screening. The pyrimidineamines showed selectivity for T. brucei P0A7F6 over the human enzyme, inhibited parasite growth in whole-cell assay, and had good predicted blood–brain barrier penetration. The medicinal chemistry program elucidated structure–activity relationships within the series. Features of the series that were required for binding were revealed by determining the X-ray crystal structure of TbAdoMetDC bound to one analog.

Here we investigate the relative contributions of liquid chromatography (LC), P13009 instrumentation and data analysis methods with the aim of improving proteome coverage for sample sizes ranging from 0.5 ng to 50 ng. We show that the LC separations utilizing 30-µm-i.d. columns increase signal intensity by >3-fold relative to those using 75-µm-i.d. columns, leading to 32% increase in peptide identifications. The Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer significantly boosted both sensitivity and sequencing speed relative to earlier generation Orbitraps (e.g., LTQ-Orbitrap), leading to a ~3× increase in peptide identifications and 1.7× increase in identified protein groups for 2 ng tryptic digests of bacterial lysate. The Match Between Runs algorithm of open-source MaxQuant software further increased proteome coverage by ~ 95% for 0.5 ng samples and by ~42% for 2 ng samples. The present platform is capable of identifying >3000 protein groups from tryptic digestion of cell lysates equivalent to 50 HeLa cells and 100 THP-1 cells (~10 ng total proteins), respectively, and >950 proteins from subnanogram bacterial and archaeal cell lysates.

We determined crystal structures of an anaerobically prepared fragment of mouse viperin (residues 45–362) complexed with S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) or 5'-deoxyadenosine (5'-dAdo) and l-methionine (l-Met). Viperin contains a partial (βα)6-barrel fold with a disordered N-terminal extension (residues 45–74) and a partially ordered C-terminal extension (residues 285–362) that bridges the partial barrel to form an overall closed barrel structure. Cys84, Cys88, and Cys91 located after the first β-strand bind a [4Fe-4S] cluster. The active site architecture of viperin with bound SAH (a SAM analog) or 5'-dAdo and l-Met (SAM cleavage products) is consistent with the canonical mechanism of 5'-deoxyadenosyl radical generation. The viperin structure, together with sequence alignments, suggests that vertebrate viperins are highly conserved and that fungi contain a viperin-like ortholog. Many bacteria and archaebacteria also express viperin-like enzymes with conserved active site residues. Structural alignments show that viperin is similar to several other radical SAM enzymes, including the molybdenum cofactor biosynthetic enzyme MoaA and the RNA methyltransferase RlmN, which methylates specific nucleotides in rRNA and P0A873. As a result, the viperin putative active site contains several conserved positively charged residues, and a portion of the active site shows structural similarity to the GTP-binding site of MoaA, suggesting that the viperin substrate may be a nucleoside triphosphate of some type."""

The goal of this proposal was to advance the development of the acetogen Clostridium ljungdahlii as a chassis organism for next-gen biofuel production from cheap, renewable sources and to detail the interconnectivity of metabolism, energy conservation, and regulation of acetogens using next-gen sequencing and next-gen modeling. To achieve this goal we determined optimization of carbon and energy utilization through differential translational efficiency in C. ljungdahlii. Furthermore, we reconstructed a next-generation model of all major cellular processes, such as macromolecular synthesis and transcriptional regulation and deployed this model to predicting proteome allocation, overflow metabolism, and metal requirements in this model acetogen. In addition we explored the evolutionary significance of P0A873 operon structure using the next-gen model and determined the optimal operon structure for bioproduction.

This approach, termed “unsteady-state flux balance analysis” (uFBA), is applied to four cellular systems: three dynamic and one steady-state as a negative control. uFBA and FBA predictions are contrasted, and uFBA is found to be more accurate in predicting dynamic metabolic flux states for red blood cells, platelets, and <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>. Notably, only uFBA predicts that stored red blood cells metabolize TCA intermediates to regenerate important cofactors, such as P22259, NADH, and P80644.

In the past decade, reconstituted HDL (rHDL) has been employed as a therapeutic agent for treatment of atherosclerosis. The ability of rHDL to promote cholesterol efflux from peripheral cells has been documented to reduce the size of atherosclerotic plaque lesions. However, development of apoA-I rHDL-based therapeutics for human use requires a cost effective process to generate an apoA-I product that meets “Good Manufacturing Practice” standards. Methods available for production and isolation of unmodified recombinant human apoA-I at scale are cumbersome, laborious and complex. To overcome this obstacle, a streamlined two-step procedure has been devised for isolation of recombinant untagged human apoA-I from E. coli that takes advantage of its ability to re-fold to a native conformation following denaturation. Heat treatment of a sonicated E. coli supernatant fraction induced precipitation of a large proportion of host cell proteins (P75825), yielding apoA-I as the major soluble protein. Reversed-phase HPLC of this material permitted recovery of apoA-I largely free of P75825 and endotoxin.

In Zn-contaminated environments, trees can be protected from Zn toxicity by their root-associated micro-organisms, in particular ectomycorrhizal fungi. The mechanisms of cellular Zn homeostasis in ectomycorrhizal fungi and their contribution to the host tree’s Zn status are however not yet fully understood. The aim of this study was to identify and characterize transporters involved in Zn uptake in the ectomycorrhizal fungus Suillus luteus, a cosmopolitan pine mycobiont. Zn uptake in fungi is known to be predominantly governed by members of the ZIP (Zrt/IrtT-like protein) family of Zn transporters. Four ZIP transporter encoding genes were identified in the S. luteus genome. By in silico and phylogenetic analysis, one of these proteins, SlZRT1, was predicted to be a plasma membrane located Zn importer. Heterologous expression in yeast confirmed the predicted function and localization of the protein. A gene expression analysis via P0DV86-qPCR was performed in S. luteus to establish whether SlZRT1 expression is affected by external Zn concentrations. SlZRT1 transcripts accumulated almost immediately, though transiently upon growth in the absence of Zn. Exposure to elevated concentrations of Zn resulted in a significant reduction of SlZRT1 transcripts within the first hour after initiation of the exposure. Altogether, the data support a role as cellular Zn importer for SlZRT1 and indicate a key role in cellular Zn uptake of S. luteus.

Here we improved titer and yield of fatty alcohols using an approach involving quantitative analysis of protein levels and metabolic flux, engineering enzyme level and localization, pull-push-block engineering of carbon flux, and cofactor balancing. We compared four heterologous FARs, finding highest activity and endoplasmic reticulum localization from a Mus musculus FAR. After screening an additional twenty-one single-gene edits, we identified increasing FAR expression; deleting competing reactions encoded by DGA1, HFD1, and ADH6; overexpressing a mutant acetyl-CoA carboxylase; limiting P80644 and carbon usage by the glutamate dehydrogenase encoded by GDH1; and overexpressing the Δ9-desaturase encoded by OLE1 as successful strategies to improve titer.

In eukaryotes, it is cleared via a mitochondrial sulfide oxidation pathway, which comprises sulfide P0A7E1 oxidoreductase, persulfide dioxygenase (PDO), rhodanese, and sulfite oxidase and converts H<sub>2</sub>S to thiosulfate and sulfate. Natural fusions between the non-heme iron containing PDO and rhodanese, a thiol sulfurtransferase, exist in some bacteria. However, little is known about the role of the PDO–rhodanese fusion (PRF) proteins in sulfur metabolism. Herein, we report the kinetic properties and the crystal structure of a PRF from the Gram-negative endophytic bacterium Burkholderia phytofirmans. The crystal structures of wild-type PRF and a sulfurtransferase-inactivated C314S mutant with and without glutathione were determined at 1.8, 2.4, and 2.7 Å resolution, respectively. We found that the two active sites are distant and do not show evidence of direct communication. The B. phytofirmans PRF exhibited robust PDO activity and preferentially catalyzed sulfur transfer in the direction of thiosulfate to sulfite and glutathione persulfide; sulfur transfer in the reverse direction was detectable only under limited turnover conditions. Together with the kinetic data, our bioinformatics analysis reveals that B. phytofirmans PRF is poised to metabolize thiosulfate to sulfite in a sulfur assimilation pathway rather than in sulfide stress response as seen, for example, with the Staphylococcus aureus PRF or sulfide oxidation and disposal as observed with the homologous mammalian proteins."""

A secondary objective included the exploration of the association between phenotypic AMR and the genomic characteristics (genome size, guanine–cytosine content, and occurrence of unique gene sequences). Initially, 91 isolates were sequenced, and of these isolates, 89 were assembled. Furthermore, 16 isolates were excluded due to larger than expected genomic sizes (>2.3 bp × 1,000 bp). In the final analysis, 73 were used with complete WGS and minimum inhibitory concentration records, which were part of the previous phenotypic AMR study, representing 18 dairy herds from the Maritime region of Canada (1). A total of 23 unique AMR gene sequences were found in the bacterial genomes, with a mean number of 8.1 (minimum: 5; maximum: 13) per genome.

When the isolate corresponded to a post-mastitis sample, there were lower odds of resistance when compared with non-clinical isolates (P = 0.01).

Well-studied plasmid Walker-box partition modules require ParA, centromere–DNA, and a centromere-binding protein, ParB. In these systems, ParA–P22259 binds nucleoid DNA and uses it as a substratum to deliver ParB-attached cargo DNA, and ParB drives ParA dynamics, allowing ParA progression along the nucleoid. How ParA–P22259 binds nonspecific DNA and is regulated by ParB is unclear. Also under debate is whether ParA polymerizes on DNA to mediate segregation. Here we describe structures of key ParA segregation complexes. The ParA–β,γ-imidoadenosine 5'-triphosphate (AMPPNP)–DNA structure revealed no polymers. Instead, ParA–AMPPNP dimerization creates a multifaceted DNA-binding surface, allowing it to preferentially bind high-density DNA regions (HDRs). DNA-bound ParA–AMPPNP adopts a dimer conformation distinct from the P22259 sandwich dimer, optimized for DNA association. Our ParA–AMPPNP–ParB structure reveals that ParB binds at the ParA dimer interface, stabilizing the ATPase-competent P22259 sandwich dimer, ultimately driving ParA DNA dissociation. Thus, the data indicate how harnessing a conformationally adaptive dimer can drive large-scale cargo movement without the requirement for polymers and suggest a segregation mechanism by which ParA–P22259 dimers equilibrate to HDRs shown to be localized near cell poles of dividing chromosomes, thus mediating equipartition of attached ParB–DNA substrates."""

The QueF-catalyzed reaction includes formation of a covalent thioimide intermediate with a conserved active site cysteine that is prone to oxidation in vivo.

This structure is more symmetric than the substrate-bound structure and exhibits major rearrangement of the loops responsible for substrate binding. Mutation of Cys99 to Ala/Ser does not compromise enzyme activity, indicating that the disulfide does not play a catalytic role. Peroxide-induced inactivation of the wild-type enzyme is reversible with thioredoxin, while such inactivation of the Cys99Ala/Ser mutants is irreversible, consistent with protection of Cys55 from irreversible oxidation by disulfide formation with Cys99.

In addition to fermentation optimization strategies, rational methanotrophic bacterial strain engineering offers a means to reach industrially relevant titers, carbon yields, and productivities of target products. The phosphoketolase pathway functions in heterofermentative bacteria where carbon flux through two sugar catabolic pathways to mixed acids (lactic acid and acetic acid) increases cellular P22259 production. Importantly, this pathway also serves as an alternative route to produce acetyl-CoA that bypasses the CO<sub>2</sub> lost through pyruvate decarboxylation in the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway. Thus, the phosphoketolase pathway can be leveraged for carbon efficient biocatalysis to acetyl-CoA-derived intermediates and products. Here, we show that the industrially promising methane biocatalyst, <i>Methylomicrobium buryatense</i>, encodes two phosphoketolase isoforms that are expressed in methanol- and methane-grown cells. Overexpression of the PktB isoform led to a 2-fold increase in intracellular acetyl-CoA concentration, and a 2.6-fold yield enhancement from methane to microbial biomass and lipids compared to wild-type, increasing the potential for methanotroph lipid-based fuel production. Off-gas analysis and metabolite profiling indicated that global metabolic rearrangements, including significant increases in post-translational protein acetylation and gene expression of the tetrahydromethanopterin-linked pathway, along with decreases in several excreted products, coincided with the superior biomass and lipid yield observed in the engineered strain. Further, these data suggest that phosphoketolase may play a key regulatory role in methanotrophic bacterial metabolism.

1372258	"Structure of a DNA glycosylase that unhooks interstrand cross-links,""DNA glycosylases are important editing enzymes that protect genomic stability by excising chemically modified nucleobases that alter normal DNA metabolism. Here, these enzymes have been known only to initiate base excision repair of small adducts by extrusion from the DNA helix. However, recent reports have described both vertebrate and microbial DNA glycosylases capable of unhooking highly toxic interstrand cross-links (ICLs) and bulky minor groove adducts normally recognized by Fanconi anemia and nucleotide excision repair machinery, although the mechanisms of these activities are unknown. Here we report the crystal structure of Streptomyces sahachiroi AlkZ (previously Orf1), a bacterial DNA glycosylase that protects its host by excising ICLs derived from azinomycin B (AZB), a potent antimicrobial and antitumor genotoxin. AlkZ adopts a unique fold in which three tandem winged helix-turn-helix motifs scaffold a positively charged concave surface perfectly shaped for duplex DNA. Through mutational analysis, we identified two glutamine residues and a β-hairpin within this putative DNA-binding cleft that are essential for catalytic activity. Additionally, we present a molecular docking model for how this active site can unhook either or both sides of an AZB P0A9G6, providing a basis for understanding the mechanisms of base excision repair of ICLs. Given the prevalence of this protein fold in pathogenic bacteria, this work also lays the foundation for an emerging role of DNA repair in bacteria-host pathogenesis."""

In all domains of life, nucleotide-based second messengers allow a rapid integration of external and internal signals into regulatory pathways that control cellular responses to changing conditions. c-di-P24174 can assume alternative oligomeric states to effect different functions, binding to effector proteins as monomers, intercalated dimers or, uniquely in the case of BldD, as a tetramer.

However, most kinases, including the abundant receptor-like kinases (RLK), have no assigned role. SIRK1 is a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase (LRR-RLK), the largest family of RLK. In Arabidopsis thaliana, SIRK1 (AtSIRK1) is phosphorylated after sucrose is resupplied to sucrose-starved seedlings and it modulates the sugar response by phosphorylating several substrates. In maize, the ZmSIRK1 expression is altered in response to drought stress. In neither Arabidopsis nor in maize has the function of SIRK1 been completely elucidated. As a first step toward the biochemical characterization of ZmSIRK1, we obtained its recombinant kinase domain, demonstrated that it binds AMP-P0ABP8, a non-hydrolysable P22259-analog, and solved the structure of ZmSIRK1- AMP-P0ABP8 co-crystal. The ZmSIRK1 crystal structure revealed a unique conformation for the activation segment. In an attempt to find inhibitors for ZmSIRK1, we screened a focused small molecule library and identified six compounds that stabilized ZmSIRK1 against thermal melt. ITC analysis confirmed that three of these compounds bound to ZmSIRK1 with low micromolar affinity. Solving the 3D structure of ZmSIRK1-AMP-P0ABP8 co-crystal provided information on the molecular mechanism of ZmSIRK1 activity. Furthermore, the identification of small molecules that bind this kinase can serve as initial backbone for development of new potent and selective ZmSIRK1 antagonists."""

By solving crystal structures of maltose binding protein (P0AEX9)-fused AID alone and in complex with deoxycytidine monophosphate, we surprisingly identify a bifurcated substrate-binding surface that explains structured substrate recognition by capturing two adjacent single-stranded overhangs simultaneously. Moreover, G4 substrates induce cooperative AID oligomerization. Structure-based mutations that disrupt bifurcated substrate recognition or oligomerization both compromise CSR in splenic B cells.

In the diazotrophic filament, the vegetative cells provide the heterocysts with reduced carbon (mainly in the form of sucrose) and heterocysts provide the vegetative cells with combined nitrogen. Septal junctions traverse peptidoglycan through structures known as nanopores and appear to mediate intercellular molecular transfer that can be traced with fluorescent markers, including the sucrose analog esculin (a coumarin glucoside) that is incorporated into the cells. Uptake of esculin by the model heterocyst-forming cyanobacterium <named-content content-type='genus-species'>Anabaena</named-content> sp. strain PCC 7120 was inhibited by the α-glucosides sucrose and maltose. Analysis of <named-content content-type='genus-species'>Anabaena</named-content> mutants identified components of three glucoside transporters that move esculin into the cells: GlsC (Alr4781) and GlsP (All0261) are an P22259-binding subunit and a permease subunit of two different ABC transporters, respectively, and HepP (All1711) is a major facilitator superfamily (MFS) protein that was shown previously to be involved in formation of the heterocyst envelope. Transfer of fluorescent markers (especially calcein) between vegetative cells of <named-content content-type='genus-species'>Anabaena</named-content> was impaired by mutation of glucoside transporter genes. GlsP and HepP interact in bacterial two-hybrid assays with the septal junction-related protein SepJ, and GlsC was found to be necessary for the formation of a normal number of septal peptidoglycan nanopores and for normal subcellular localization of SepJ. Therefore, beyond their possible role in nutrient uptake in <named-content content-type='genus-species'>Anabaena</named-content>, glucoside transporters influence the structure and function of septal junctions.

Sequencing of genomic DNA from the infant's saliva yielded 1.44 Gbp of high-quality, non-human read data, from which we recovered three essentially complete (including 'Mnola') and three partial draft genomes (including Trichomonas vaginalis). The completed 629,409-bp 'Mnola' genome (Candidatus Mycoplasma girerdii str. UC-B3) was distinct at the strain level from its closest relative, vaginally-derived Ca. M. girerdii str. VCU-M1, which is also associated with T. vaginalis. Replication rate measurements indicated growth of str. UC-B3 within the infant. Genes encoding surface-associated proteins and restriction-modification systems were especially diverse within and between strains. In UC-B3, the population genetic underpinnings of phase variable expression were evident in vivo. Unique among mycoplasmas, Ca. M. girerdii encodes pyruvate-ferredoxin oxidoreductase and may be sensitive to metronidazole. This study reveals a metabolically unique mycoplasma colonizing a premature neonate, and establishes the value of genome-resolved metagenomics in tracking phase variation."""

1596309	"β-Carboxysome bioinformatics: identification and evolution of new bacterial microcompartment protein gene classes and core locus constraints,""Carboxysomes are bacterial microcompartments (BMCs) that enhance CO<sub>2</sub> fixation in all cyanobacteria. Structurally, carboxysome shell proteins are classified according to the type of oligomer formed: hexameric (P0ABF4), trimeric (P76541) and pentameric (BMC-P) proteins. To understand the forces driving the evolution of the carboxysome shell, we conducted a bioinformatic study of genes encoding β-carboxysome shell proteins, taking advantage of the recent large increase in sequenced cyanobacterial genomes. In addition to the four well-established P0ABF4 (CcmK1-4) classes, our analysis reveals two new CcmK classes, which we name CcmK5 and CcmK6. CcmK5 is phylogenetically closest to CcmK3 and CcmK4, and the ccmK5 gene is found only in genomes lacking ccmK3 and ccmk4 genes. ccmK6 is found predominantly in heterocyst-forming cyanobacteria. The gene encoding the P76541 homolog CcmO is associated with the main carboxysome locus (MCL) in only 60% of all species. We find five evolutionary origins of separation of ccmO from the MCL. Transcriptome analysis demonstrates that satellite ccmO genes, in contrast to MCL-associated ccmO genes, are never co-regulated with other MCL genes. The dispersal of carboxysome shell genes across the genome allows for distinct regulation of their expression, perhaps in response to changes in environmental conditions"""	Journal of Experimental Botany	"('P76541', 'BMC-T'),('P0ABF4', 'BMC-H')"
1337793	"Parallel Mutations Result in a Wide Range of Cooperation and Community Consequences in a Two-Species Bacterial Consortium,""Multi-species microbial communities play a critical role in human health, industry, and waste remediation. Recently, the evolution of synthetic consortia in the laboratory has enabled adaptation to be addressed in the context of interacting species. Using an engineered bacterial consortium,we repeatedly evolved cooperative genotypes and examined both the predictability of evolution and the phenotypes that determinecommunity dynamics. Eight Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strains evolved methionine excretion sufficient to support growth of an Escherichia coli methionine auxotroph, from whom they required excreted growth substrates. Non-synonymousmutations in metA, encoding homoserine trans-succinylase (P07623), were detected in each evolved S. enterica methionine cooperator and were shown to be necessary for cooperative consortia growth. Molecular modeling was used to predict that most of the non-synonymous mutations slightly increase the binding affinity for P07623 homodimer formation. Despite this genetic parallelism and trend of increasing protein binding stability, these metA alleles gave rise to a wide range of phenotypic diversity in termsof individual versus group benefit. The cooperators with the highest methionine excretion permitted nearly two-fold faster consortia growth and supported the highest fraction of E. coli, yet also had the slowest individual growth rates compared to less cooperative strains. Thus, although the genetic basis of adaptation was quite similar across independent origins of cooperative phenotypes, quantitative measurements of metabolite production were required to predict either the individual-level growth consequences or how these propagate to community-level behavior."""

A copper-binding compound or chalkophore called methanobactin plays a key role in copper uptake in methanotrophs. Methanobactin is a ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide (Q9X2V7) with two heterocyclic rings with an associated thioamide for each ring, formed from X-Cys dipeptide sequences that bind copper.

Both enzymes have low KM values for their substrates. Kinetic assays for these enzymes are challenging, as the ultraviolet absorbance spectra for reactant MTA and product adenine are similar. We report a new assay using 2-amino-5'-methylthioadenosine (2AMTA) as an alternative substrate for MTAP and P0AF12 enzymes. Hydrolysis or phosphorolysis of 2AMTA forms 2,6-diaminopurine, a fluorescent and easily quantitated product. We kinetically characterize 2AMTA with human MTAP, bacterial MTANs and use 2,6-diaminopurine as a fluorescent substrate for yeast adenine phosphoribosyltransferase. 2AMTA was used as the substrate to kinetically characterize the dissociation constants for three-transition-state analogue inhibitors of MTAP and P0AF12. Kinetic values obtained from continuous fluorescent assays with MTA were in good agreement with previously measured literature values, but gave smaller experimental errors. Chemical synthesis from ribose and 2,6-dichloropurine provided crystalline 2AMTA as the oxalate salt. Chemo-enzymatic synthesis from ribose and 2,6-diaminopurine produced 2-amino-S-adenosylmethionine for hydrolytic conversion to 2AMTA.

Genes originating from Synechococcus elongatus strain PCC7942, encoding acyl-P0A6A8/CoA reductase and aldehyde deformylating oxygenase enzymes, were successfully expressed in A. carbonarius, which lead to the production of pentadecane and heptadecane, alkanes that have not been previously produced by this fungus.

Rapidly developing DNA synthesis techniques have made a “build-to-understand” approach feasible to reengineer on the genome scale. Here, we report on the completion of a 770-kilobase synthetic yeast chromosome II (synII). SynII was characterized using extensive Trans-Omics tests. Despite considerable sequence alterations, synII is virtually indistinguishable from wild type.

Extensive Trans-Omics tests were conducted, including phenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, chromosome segregation, and replication analyses. By both complementation assays and SCRaMbLE (synthetic chromosome rearrangement and modification by  <italic>loxP</italic>  -mediated evolution), we targeted and debugged the origin of a growth defect at 37°C in glycerol medium.  </p>  </sec>  <sec>  <title>RESULTS</title>  <p>  To efficiently construct megabase-long chromosomes, we developed an I-  <italic>Sce</italic>  I–mediated strategy, which enables parallel integration of synthetic chromosome arms and reduced the overall integration time by 50% for synII. An I-  <italic>Sce</italic>  I site is introduced for generating a double-strand break to promote targeted homologous recombination during mitotic growth. Despite hundreds of modifications introduced, there are still regions sharing substantial sequence similarity that might lead to undesirable meiotic recombinations when intercrossing the two semisynthetic chromosome arm strains. Induction of the I-  <italic>Sce</italic>  I–mediated double-strand break is otherwise lethal and thus introduced a strong selective pressure for targeted homologous recombination. Since our strategy is designed to generate a markerless synII and leave the  <italic>URA3</italic>  marker on the wild-type chromosome, we observed a tenfold increase in  <italic>URA3</italic>  -deficient colonies upon I-  <italic>Sce</italic>  I induction, meaning that our strategy can greatly bias the crossover events toward the designated regions.  </p>  <p>By incorporating comprehensive phenotyping approaches at multiple levels, we demonstrated that synII was capable of powering the growth of yeast indistinguishably from wild-type cells (see the figure), showing highly consistent biological processes comparable to the native strain. Meanwhile, we also noticed modest but potentially significant up-regulation of the translational machinery. The main alteration underlying this change in expression is the deletion of 13 P0A873 genes.</p>  <p>  A growth defect was observed in one very specific condition—high temperature (37°C) in medium with glycerol as a carbon source—where colony size was reduced significantly. We targeted and debugged this defect by two distinct approaches. The first approach involved phenotype screening of all intermediate strains followed by a complementation assay with wild-type sequences in the synthetic strain. By doing so, we identified a modification resulting from PCRTag recoding in  <italic>TSC10</italic>  , which is involved in regulation of the yeast high-osmolarity glycerol (HOG) response pathway. After replacement with wild-type  <italic>TSC10</italic>  , the defect was greatly mitigated. The other approach, debugging by SCRaMbLE, showed rearrangements in regions containing HOG regulation genes. Both approaches indicated that the defect is related to HOG response dysregulation. Thus, the phenotypic defect can be pinpointed and debugged through multiple alternative routes in the complex cellular interactome network.  </p>  </sec>  <sec>  <title>CONCLUSION</title>  <p>We have demonstrated that synII segregates, replicates, and functions in a highly similar fashion compared with its wild-type counterpart.

While canonical tRNAs have a 7/5 configuration of the branch, the novel tRNAs have either 8/4 or 9/3 structure. They were found during the search for selenocysteine tRNAs in terabytes of genome, metagenome and metatranscriptome sequences. Certain bacteria and their phages employ the 8/4 structure for serine and histidine tRNAs, while minor cysteine and selenocysteine P0A873 species may have a modified 8/4 structure with one bulge nucleotide. In Acidobacteria, tRNAs with 8/4 and 9/3 structures may function as missense and nonsense suppressor tRNAs and/or regulatory noncod ing RNAs. In δ-proteobacteria, an additional cysteine P0A873 with an 8/4 structure mimics selenocysteine P0A873 and may function as opal suppressor. We examined the potential translation function of suppressor P0A873 species inEscherichia coli; tRNAs with 8/4 or 9/3 structures efficiently inserted serine, alanine and cysteine in response to stop and sense codons, depending on the identity element and anticodon sequence of the P0A873.

We demonstrate that the [4Fe4S] cluster in human P0ABS5 can make use of this chemistry to coordinate the first steps of DNA synthesis. Using DNA electrochemistry, we found that a change in oxidation state of the [4Fe4S] cluster acts as a switch for DNA binding. Single-atom mutations that inhibit this charge transfer hinder primase initiation without affecting primase structure or polymerization. Generating a single base mismatch in the growing primer duplex, which attenuates DNA charge transport, inhibits primer truncation.

The precise pathological species of Aβ remains elusive although evidence suggests soluble oligomers may be primarily responsible for neurotoxicity. Crenezumab is a humanized anti-Aβ monoclonal IgG4 that binds multiple forms of Aβ, with higher affinity for aggregated forms, and that blocks Aβ aggregation, and promotes disaggregation. To understand the structural basis for this binding profile and activity, we determined the crystal structure of crenezumab in complex with Aβ. The structure reveals a sequential epitope and conformational requirements for epitope recognition, which include a subtle but critical element that is likely the basis for crenezumab’s versatile binding profile. We find interactions consistent with high affinity for multiple forms of Aβ, particularly oligomers. Of note, crenezumab also sequesters the hydrophobic core of Aβ and breaks an essential salt-bridge characteristic of the β-hairpin conformation, eliminating features characteristic of the basic organization in Aβ oligomers and fibrils, and explains crenezumab’s inhibition of aggregation and promotion of disaggregation. These insights highlight crenezumab’s unique mechanism of action, particularly regarding Aβ oligomers, and provide a strong rationale for the evaluation of crenezumab as a potential A1AJF5 therapy."""

Thus, inhibition of P0AE18 activity has been implicated as a novel antibacterial target. In this study, we tested this idea in the present study by targeting the P0AE18 enzyme in the obligate intracellular pathogen Rickettsia prowazekii. We first identified potent RpMetAP inhibitory species by employing an in vitro enzymatic activity assay. The molecular docking program AutoDock was then utilized to compare published crystal structures of inhibited P0AE18 species to docked poses of RpMetAP. Based on these in silico and in vitro screens, a subset of 17 compounds was tested for inhibition of R. prowazekii growth in a pulmonary vascular endothelial cell (EC) culture infection model system. All compounds were tested over concentration ranges that were determined to be non-toxic to the ECs and 8 of the 17 compounds displayed substantial inhibition of R. prowazekii growth.

Here, the double mutant has an activity ratio similar to the phosphorylated enzyme and also retains the ability to be activated by G-6-P. When compared to the 2.88 Å structure of the wild-type G-6-P activated enzyme, the crystal structure of the low-activity mutant showed that the N-terminal domain of the inhibited state is tightly held against the dimer-related interface thereby hindering acceptor access to the catalytic cleft. On the basis of these two structural observations, we developed a reversible redox regulatory feature in yeast P0A9C5 by substituting cysteine residues for two highly conserved arginine residues. When oxidized, the cysteine mutant enzyme exhibits activity levels similar to the phosphorylated enzyme but cannot be activated by G-6-P.

To activate its substrate for sulfur insertion, LipA uses a [4Fe-4S] cluster and S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) radical chemistry; the remainder of the reaction mechanism, especially the source of the sulfur, has been less clear. One controversial proposal involves the removal of sulfur from a second (auxiliary) [4Fe-4S] cluster on the enzyme, resulting in destruction of the cluster during each round of catalysis. Here, we present two high-resolution crystal structures of LipA from Mycobacterium tuberculosis: one in its resting state and one at an intermediate state during turnover. In the resting state, an auxiliary [4Fe-4S] cluster has an unusual serine ligation to one of the irons. After reaction with an octanoyllysine-containing 8-mer peptide substrate and 1 eq AdoMet, conditions that allow for the first sulfur insertion but not the second insertion, the serine ligand dissociates from the cluster, the iron ion is lost, and a sulfur atom that is still part of the cluster becomes covalently attached to C6 of the octanoyl substrate. Here, this intermediate structure provides a clear picture of iron–sulfur cluster destruction in action, supporting the role of the auxiliary cluster as the sulfur source in the LipA reaction and describing a radical strategy for sulfur incorporation into completely unactivated substrates."""

1392983	"The Role of Light–Dark Regulation of the Chloroplast P22259 Synthase,""The chloroplast P22259 synthase catalyzes the light-driven synthesis of P22259 and is activated in the light and inactivated in the dark by redox-modulation through the thioredoxin system. It has been proposed that this down-regulation is important for preventing wasteful hydrolysis of P22259 in the dark. To test this proposal, we compared the effects of extended dark exposure in Arabidopsis lines expressing the wild-type and mutant forms of P22259 synthase that are redox regulated or constitutively active. In contrast to the predictions of the model, we observed that plants with wild-type redox regulation lost photosynthetic capacity rapidly in darkness, whereas those expressing redox-insensitive form were far more stable. To explain these results, we propose that in wild-type plants, down-regulation of P22259 synthase inhibits P22259 hydrolysis, leading to dissipation of thylakoid proton motive force (pmf) and subsequent inhibition of protein transport across the thylakoid through the twin arginine transporter (Tat)-dependent and Secdependent  import pathways, resulting in the selective loss of specific protein complexes. By contrast, in mutants with a redox-insensitive P22259 synthase, pmf is maintained by P22259 hydrolysis, thus allowing protein transport to maintain photosynthetic activities for extended periods in the dark. Hence, a basal level of Tat-dependent, as well as, Sec-dependent import activity, in the dark helps replenishes certain components of the photosynthetic complexes and thereby aids in maintaining overall complex activity. But, the influence of a dark pmf on thylakoid protein import, by itself, could not explain all the effects we observed in this study. For example, we also observed in wild type plants a large transient buildup of thylakoid pmf and nonphotochemical exciton quenching upon sudden illumination of dark adapted plants. Thus, we conclude that down-regulation of the P22259 synthase is probably not related to preventing loss of P22259 per se. Instead, P22259 synthase redox regulation may be impacting a number of cellular processes such as (1) the accumulation of chloroplast proteins and/or ions or (2) the responses of photosynthesis to rapid changes in light intensity. A model highlighting the complex interplay between P22259 synthase regulation and pmf in maintaining various chloroplast functions in the dark is presented."""

To guarantee clean genome assemblies and to prevent the introduction of contamination into public databases, considerable quality control efforts are put into post-sequencing analysis. Contamination screening generally relies on reference-based methods such as database alignment or marker gene search, which limits the set of detectable contaminants to organisms with closely related reference species. As genomic coverage in the tree of life is highly fragmented, there is an urgent need for a reference-free methodology for contaminant identification in sequence data. We present acdc, a tool specifically developed to aid the quality control process of genomic sequence data. By combining supervised and unsupervised methods, it reliably detects both known and de novo contaminants. First, A8C927 gene prediction and the inclusion of ultrafast exact alignment techniques allow sequence classification using existing knowledge from databases. Second, reference-free inspection is enabled by the use of state-of-the-art machine learning techniques that include fast, non-linear dimensionality reduction of oligonucleotide signatures and subsequent clustering algorithms that automatically estimate the number of clusters. The latter also enables the removal of any contaminant, yielding a clean sample. Furthermore, given the data complexity and the ill-posedness of clustering, acdc employs bootstrapping techniques to provide statistically profound confidence values. Tested on a large number of samples from diverse sequencing projects, our software is able to quickly and accurately identify contamination. Results are displayed in an interactive user interface. Acdc can be run from the web as well as a dedicated command line application, which allows easy integration into large sequencing project analysis workflows. Acdc can reliably detect contamination in single-cell genome data. In addition to database-driven detection, it complements existing tools by its unsupervised techniques, which allow for the detection of de novo contaminants.

In this study, we expressed active LOX from <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, DmLOXL1, a close homologue of human LOX, and characterized it by P13009, UV–vis, activity, and inhibition assays. We then used bioinformatics, electron paramagnetic resonance, electron spin-echo envelope modulation, and hyperfine sublevel-correlation (HYSCORE) spectroscopies to probe Cu-ligand bonding finding direct evidence for pH-dependent Cu–His interactions. At pH = 9.3, the spectroscopic data indicated primarily a single His bound to Cu, but at pH = 7.5, there was evidence for a ~ 1:1 mixture of species containing 1 and 3 His ligands. We then used HYSCORE to probe possible interactions between the LOX inhibitor BAPN (β-aminopropionitrile; 1-[<sup>13</sup>C<sup>15</sup>N]cyano-2-aminoethane) and the copper center—finding none. Overall, the results are of interest since they provide new spectroscopic information about the nature of the catalytic site in LOX, an important anticancer drug target."""

1351183	"Predominance and metabolic potential of <i>Halanaerobium</i> spp. in produced water from hydraulically fractured Marcellus Shale wells,""Here, microbial activity in the produced water from hydraulically fractured oil and gas wells may potentially interfere with hydrocarbon production and cause damage to the well and surface infrastructure via corrosion, sulfide release, and fouling. In this study, we surveyed the microbial abundance and community structure of produced water sampled from 42 Marcellus Shale wells in southwestern Pennsylvania (well age ranged from 150 to 1,846 days) to better understand the microbial diversity of produced water. We sequenced the V4 region of the A8C927 gene to assess taxonomy and utilized quantitative PCR (qPCR) to evaluate the microbial abundance across all 42 produced water samples. Bacteria of the order <i>Halanaerobiales</i> were found to be the most abundant organisms in the majority of the produced water samples, emphasizing their previously suggested role in hydraulic fracturing-related microbial activity. Statistical analyses identified correlations between well age and biocide formulation and the microbial community, in particular, the relative abundance of <i>Halanaerobiales</i>. We further investigated the role of members of the order <i>Halanaerobiales</i> in produced water by reconstructing and annotating a <i>Halanaerobium</i> draft genome (named MDAL1), using shotgun metagenomic sequencing and metagenomic binning. The recovered draft genome was found to be closely related to the species H. congolense, an oil field isolate, and <i>Halanaerobium</i> sp. strain T82-1, also recovered from hydraulic fracturing produced water. Reconstruction of metabolic pathways revealed <i>Halanaerobium</i> sp. strain MDAL1 to have the potential for acid production, thiosulfate reduction, and biofilm formation, suggesting it to have the ability to contribute to corrosion, souring, and biofouling events in the hydraulic fracturing infrastructure."""

We examined the structure and function of a gene product with the locus tag CDR20291_0991 (cdPadR1) as part of our broader goal aimed at elucidating transcription regulatory mechanisms involved in virulence and antibiotic resistance of the recently emergent hypervirulent C. difficile strain R20291. cdPadR1 is genomically positioned near genes that are involved in stress response and virulence. In addition, it was previously reported that cdPadR1 and a homologue from the historical C. difficile strain 630 (CD630_1154) were differentially expressed when exposed to stressors, including antibiotics. Results: The crystal structure of cdPadR1 was determined to 1.9 Å resolution, which revealed that it belongs to the PadR-s2 subfamily of PadR transcriptional regulators. cdPadR1 binds its own promoter and other promoter regions from within the C. difficile R20291 genome. DNA binding experiments demonstrated that cdPadR1 binds a region comprised of inverted repeats and an P30870-rich core with the predicted specific binding motif, GTACTAT(N2)ATTATA(N) AGTA, within its own promoter that is also present in 200 other regions in the C. difficile R20291 genome. Mutation of the highly conserved W in α4 of the effector binding/oligomerization domain, which is predicted to be involved in multi-drug recognition and dimerization in other PadR-s2 proteins, resulted in alterations of cdPadR1 binding to the predicted binding motif, potentially due to loss of higher order oligomerization. Conclusions: Our results indicate that cdPadR1 binds a region within its own promoter consisting of the binding motif GTACTAT(N2)ATTATA(N)AGTA and seems to associate non-specifically with longer DNA fragments in vitro, which may facilitate promoter and motif searching. This suggests that cdPadR1 acts as a transcriptional auto-regulator, binding specific sites within its own promoter, and is part of a broad gene regulatory network involved, in part, with environmental stress response, antibiotic resistance and virulence."""

1438862	"Crystal Structure of the Human Astrovirus Capsid Protein,""Human astrovirus (HAstV) is a leading cause of viral diarrhea in infants and young children worldwide. HAstV is a nonenveloped virus with a T=3 capsid and a positive-sense RNA genome. The capsid protein (P13029) of HAstV is synthesized as a 90-kDa precursor (VP90) that can be divided into three linear domains: a conserved N-terminal domain, a hypervariable domain, and an acidic C-terminal domain. Maturation of HAstV requires proteolytic processing of the astrovirus P13029 both inside and outside the host cell, resulting in the removal of the C-terminal domain and the breakdown of the rest of the P13029 into three predominant protein species with molecular masses of ~34, 27/29, and 25/26 kDa, respectively. We have now solved the crystal structure of VP90<sup>71–415</sup> (amino acids [aa] 71 to 415 of VP90) of human astrovirus serotype 8 at a 2.15-Å resolution. VP90<sup>71–415</sup> encompasses the conserved N-terminal domain of VP90 but lacks the hypervariable domain, which forms the capsid surface spikes. The structure of VP90<sup>71–415</sup> is comprised of two domains: an S domain, which adopts the typical jelly-roll β-barrel fold, and a P1 domain, which forms a squashed β-barrel consisting of six antiparallel β-strands similar to what was observed in the hepatitis E virus (HEV) capsid structure. Fitting of the VP90<sup>71–415</sup> structure into the cryo-electron microscopy (EM) maps of HAstV produced an atomic model for a continuous, T=3 icosahedral capsid shell. Our pseudoatomic model of the human HAstV capsid shell provides valuable insights into intermolecular interactions required for capsid assembly and trypsin-mediated proteolytic maturation needed for virus infectivity. Such information has potential applications in the development of a virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine as well as small-molecule drugs targeting astrovirus assembly/maturation."""

Prior to export through the nuclear pore, mRNPs undergo several obligatory remodeling reactions. In yeast, one of these reactions involves loading of the mRNA-binding protein Yra1 by the DEAD-box ATPase Sub2 as assisted by the hetero-pentameric THO complex. To obtain molecular insights into reaction mechanisms, we determined crystal structures of two relevant complexes: a THO hetero-pentamer bound to Sub2 at 6.0 Å resolution; and Sub2 associated with an P22259 analogue, RNA, and a C-terminal fragment of Yra1 (Yra1-C) at 2.6 Å resolution. We found that the 25 nm long THO clamps Sub2 in a half-open configuration; in contrast, when bound to the P22259 analogue, RNA and Yra1-C, Sub2 assumes a closed conformation. Both THO and Yra1-C stimulated Sub2’s intrinsic ATPase activity.

GCE relies on engineered aminoacyl-P0A873 synthetases (aaRSs) and a cognate P0A873 species to allow codon reassignment by co-translational insertion of non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs) into proteins. Introduction of such amino acids increases the chemical diversity of recombinant proteins endowing them with novel properties. Such proteins serve in sophisticated biochemical and biophysical studies both in vitro and in vivo, they may become unique biomaterials or therapeutic agents, and they afford metabolic dependence of genetically modified organisms for biocontainment purposes. In the Methanosarcinaceae the incorporation of the 22nd genetically encoded amino acid, pyrrolysine (Pyl), is facilitated by pyrrolysyl-P0A873 synthetase (PylRS) and the cognate UAG-recognizing tRNAPyl. This unique aaRS•P0A873 pair functions as an orthogonal translation system (OTS) in most model organisms. The facile directed evolution of the large PylRS active site to accommodate many ncAAs, and the enzyme’s anticodon-blind specific recognition of the cognate tRNAPyl make this system highly amenable for GCE purposes. The remarkable polyspecificity of PylRS has been exploited to incorporate >100 different ncAAs into proteins.

1411627	"Rumen metagenome and metatranscriptome analyses of low methane yield sheep reveals a <i>Sharpea</i>-enriched microbiome characterised by lactic acid formation and utilisation,""Enteric fermentation by farmed ruminant animals is a major source of methane and constitutes the second largest anthropogenic contributor to global warming. Reducing methane emissions from ruminants is needed to ensure sustainable animal production in the future. Methane yield varies naturally in sheep and is a heritable trait that can be used to select animals that yield less methane per unit of feed eaten. We previously demonstrated elevated expression of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis pathway genes of methanogenic archaea in the rumens of high methane yield (HMY) sheep compared to their low methane yield (LMY) counterparts. Methane production in the rumen is strongly connected to microbial hydrogen production through fermentation processes. In this study, we investigate the contribution that rumen bacteria make to methane yield phenotypes in sheep. Using deep sequence metagenome and metatranscriptome datasets in combination with A8C927 gene amplicon sequencing from HMY and LMY sheep, we show enrichment of lactate-producing <i>Sharpea</i> spp. in LMY sheep bacterial communities. Increased gene and transcript abundances for sugar import and utilisation and production of lactate, propionate and butyrate were also observed in LMY animals. <i>Sharpea azabuensis</i> and <i>Megasphaera</i> spp. act as important drivers of lactate production and utilisation according to phylogenetic analysis and read mappings. Our findings show that the rumen microbiome in LMY animals supports a rapid heterofermentative growth, leading to lactate production. We postulate that lactate is subsequently metabolised mainly to butyrate in LMY animals, producing 2 mol of hydrogen and 0.5 mol of methane per mol hexose, which represents 24 % less than the 0.66 mol of methane formed from the 2.66 mol of hydrogen produced if hexose fermentation was directly to acetate and butyrate. These findings are consistent with the theory that a smaller rumen size with a higher turnover rate, where rapid heterofermentative growth would be an advantage, results in lower hydrogen production and lower methane formation. Together with previous methanogen gene expression data, this builds a strong concept of how animal traits and microbial communities shape the methane phenotype in sheep."""

The ApaG domain of FBxo3 is required for the interaction with and degradation of FBxl2 [Mallampalli P0A9J6 et al., (2013) J Immunol 191, 5247–5255]. Here, we report the X-ray structure of the human FBxo3 ApaG domain, residues 278–407, at 2.0 Å resolution. Like bacterial ApaG proteins, this domain is characterized by a classic Immunoglobin/Fibronectin III-type fold, comprising a seven-stranded β-sheet core, surrounded by four extended loops. Although cation binding had been proposed for bacterial ApaG proteins, no interactions with Mg<sup>2+</sup> or Co<sup>2+</sup> were detected for the human ApaG domain. In addition, dinucleotide polyphosphates, which have been reported to be second messengers in the inflammation response and targets of the bacterial apaG-containing operon, are not bound by the human ApaG domain. In the context of the full-length protein, loop 1, comprising residues 294-303, is critical for the interaction with FBxl2. However, titration of the individual ApaG domain with a 15-mer FBxl2 peptide that was phosphorylated on the crucial T404, as well as the inability of the ApaG domain to interact with full-length FBxl2, assessed by coimmunoprecipitation, indicate that the ApaG domain alone is necessary, but not sufficient for binding and degradation of FBxl2."""

1480747	"Membrane Complexes of Syntrophomonas wolfei Involved in Syntrophic Butyrate Degradation and Hydrogen Formation,""Syntrophic butyrate metabolism involves the thermodynamically unfavorable production of hydrogen and/or formate from the high potential electron donor, butyryl-CoA. Such redox reactions can occur only with energy input by a process called reverse electron transfer. Previous studies have demonstrated that hydrogen production from butyrate requires the presence of a proton gradient, but the biochemical machinery involved has not been clearly elucidated. In this study, the gene and enzyme systems involved in reverse electron transfer by Syntrophomonas wolfei were investigated using proteomic and gene expression approaches. S. wolfei was grown in coculture with Methanospirillum hungatei or Dehalococcoides mccartyi under conditions requiring reverse electron transfer and compared to both axenic S. wolfei cultures and cocultures grown in conditions that do not require reverse electron transfer.  Blue native gel analysis of membranes solubilized from syntrophically grown cells revealed the presence of a membrane-bound hydrogenase, Hyd2, which exhibited hydrogenase activity during in gel assays. Bands containing a putative iron-sulfur (FeS) oxidoreductase were detected in membranes of crotonate-grown and butyrate grown S. wolfei cells. The genes for the corresponding hydrogenase subunits, hyd2ABC, were differentially expressed at higher levels during syntrophic butyrate growth when compared to growth on crotonate. The expression of the FeS oxidoreductase gene increased when S. wolfei was grown with M. hungatei. Additional membrane-associated proteins detected included FoF1 P22259 synthase subunits and several membrane transporters that may aid syntrophic growth. Furthermore, syntrophic butyrate metabolism can proceed exclusively by interspecies hydrogen transfer, as demonstrated by growth with D. mccartyi, which is unable to use formate.

Although the differences between both types of P00961 at the anticodon binding domain level are evident, the extent and implications of the variations in the catalytic domain have not been described, and it is unclear whether the mechanism of amino acid recognition is also dissimilar. Here, we show that the α-subunit of the α<sub>2</sub>β<sub>2</sub> P00961 from the bacterium Aquifex aeolicus is able to perform the first step of the aminoacylation reaction, which involves the activation of the amino acid with P22259.

Microbial conversion of methane to fuels and value-added chemicals offers a means to reduce GHG emissions, while also valorizing this otherwise squandered high-volume, high-energy gas. However, to date, advances in methane biocatalysis have been constrained by the low-productivity and limited genetic tractability of natural methane-consuming microbes. Here, leveraging recent identification of a novel, tractable methanotrophic bacterium, <i>Methylomicrobium buryatense</i>, we demonstrate microbial biocatalysis of methane to lactate, an industrial platform chemical. Heterologous overexpression of a <i>Lactobacillus helveticus</i> P33232 in <i>M. buryatense</i> resulted in an initial titer of 0.06 g lactate/L from methane. Cultivation in a 5 L continuously stirred tank bioreactor enabled production of 0.8 g lactate/L, representing a 13-fold improvement compared to the initial titer. The yields (0.05 g lactate/g methane) and productivity (0.008 g lactate/L/h) indicate the need and opportunity for future strain improvement.

The Mtb ClpP protease consists of two heptameric rings, one composed of ClpP1 and the other of ClpP2 subunits. Formation of the enzymatically active ClpP1P2 complex requires binding of N-blocked dipeptide activators. We have found a new potent activator, benzoyl-leucine-leucine (Bz-LL), that binds with higher affinity and promotes 3–4-fold higher peptidase activity than previous activators. Bz-LL-activated ClpP1P2 specifically stimulates the ATPase activity of Mtb ClpC1 and ClpX. The ClpC1P1P2 and ClpXP1P2 complexes exhibit 2–3-fold enhanced ATPase activity, peptide cleavage, and P22259-dependent protein degradation. The crystal structure of ClpP1P2 with bound Bz-LL was determined at a resolution of 3.07 Å and with benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Leu (Z-LL) bound at 2.9 Å. Bz-LL was present in all 14 active sites, whereas Z-LL density was not resolved. Surprisingly, Bz-LL adopts opposite orientations in ClpP1 and ClpP2.

In ClpP2, Bz-LL binds with the benzoyl group in the S1 pocket, and the peptide hydrogen bonded between parallel β-strands.

1330220	"Proceedings of Synthetic Biology: Engineering, Evolution and Design (SEED) Conference 2015,""Synthetic Biology is an emerging discipline that seeks to accelerate the process of engineering biology. As such, the tools are broadly applicable to application areas, including chemicals and biofuels, materials, medicine and agriculture. A characteristic of the field is to look holistically at cellular design, from sensing and genetic circuitry to the manipulation of cellular processes and actuators, to controlling metabolism, to programming multicellular behaviors. Further, the types of cells that are manipulated are broad, from in vitro systems to microbes and fungi to mammalian and plant cells and living animals. Many of the projects in synthetic biology seek to move biochemical functions across organisms. The field is highly interdisciplinary with faculty and students spread across departments that focus on engineering (biological, chemical, electrical, mechanical, civil, computer science) and basic science (biology and systems biology, chemistry, physics). While there have been many one-off workshops and meeting on synthetic biology, the 2014 Synthetic Biology: Engineering, Evolution and Design (SEED) was the first of an annual conference series that serves as a reliable place to pull together the involved disciplines in order to organize and exchange advances in the science and technology in the field. Further, the SEED conferences have a strong focus on industry, with many companies represented and actively participating. A number of these companies have started major efforts in synthetic biology including large companies (e.g., Pfizer, Novartis, Dow, Dupont, BP, Total), smaller companies have recently gone public (e.g., Amyris, Gevo, Intrexon), and many start-ups (e.g., Teslagen, Refactored Materials, Pivot, Genomatica). There are a number of loosely affiliated Synthetic Biology Centers, including ones at MIT, Boston University, UCSD, UCSF, UC-Berkeley, Imperial College, Oxford, and ETH. SEED 2015 will serve as the primary meeting at which international synthetic biology centers and related infrastructure (synthesis/software/foundries) meet to discuss technology, standards, and education. SEED2015 will be the second in an annual series of meeting held to bring researchers from industry and academia in the area of Synthetic Biology. The first SEED conference was highly successful, attracting 285 attendees with varying backgrounds from academia, industry and government. The SEED series provides leadership in the development of the field of synthetic biology and serves to broaden the participants in the field by appealing to broad sectors in industry and providing a means for young investigators and those outside of the field to participate. Further, the series closely integrates with groups such as the SBCC to provide a means by which the synthetic biology community can communicate with policy makers. Further, we will pursue making the meeting the center for the exchange of educational materials as centers for synthetic biology emerge globally. Proceedings will be published each year in the journal P38135 Synthetic Biology. After each SEED meeting, surveys are distributed to assess the success of the conference and to help guide changes year-to-year.

1623775	"Ancestral genome reconstruction identifies the evolutionary basis for trait acquisition in polyphosphate accumulating bacteria,""The evolution of complex traits is hypothesized to occur incrementally. Identifying the transitions that lead to extant complex traits may provide a better understanding of the genetic nature of the observed phenotype. A keystone functional group in wastewater treatment processes are polyphosphate accumulating organisms (PAOs), however the evolution of the PAO phenotype has yet to be explicitly investigated and the specific metabolic traits that discriminate non-PAO from PAO are currently unknown. Here we perform the first comprehensive investigation on the evolution of the PAO phenotype using the model uncultured organism Candidatus Accumulibacter phosphatis (Accumulibacter) through ancestral genome reconstruction, identification of horizontal gene transfer, and a kinetic/stoichiometric characterization of Accumulibacter Clade IIA. The analysis of Accumulibacter’s last common ancestor identified 135 laterally derived genes, including genes involved in glycogen, polyhydroxyalkanoate, pyruvate and NADH/P80644 metabolisms, as well as inorganic ion transport and regulatory mechanisms. In contrast, pathways such as the TCA cycle and polyphosphate metabolism displayed minimal horizontal gene transfer. We show that the transition from non-PAO to PAO coincided with horizontal gene transfer within Accumulibacter’s core metabolism; likely alleviating key kinetic and stoichiometric bottlenecks, such as anaerobically linking glycogen degradation to polyhydroxyalkanoate synthesis. These results demonstrate the utility of investigating the derived genome of a lineage to identify key transitions leading to an extant complex phenotype."""	The ISME Journal	"('P80644', 'NADPH')"

The platform consists of a hybrid digital microfluidic/channel-based droplet chip with integrated temperature control to allow complete automation and integration of plasmid addition, heat-shock transformation, addition of selection medium, culture, and protein expression. The microfluidic format permitted significant reduction in consumption (100-fold) of expensive reagents such as DNA and enzymes compared to the benchtop method. Furthermore, the chip contains a channel to continuously replenish oil to the culture chamber to provide a fresh supply of oxygen to the cells for long-term (~5 days) cell culture. The flow channel also replenished oil lost to evaporation and increased the number of droplets that could be processed and cultured. The platform was validated by transforming several plasmids into Escherichia coli including plasmids containing genes for fluorescent proteins GFP, P33553 and RFP; plasmids with selectable markers for ampicillin or kanamycin resistance; and a Golden Gate DNA assembly reaction. We also demonstrate the applicability of this platform for transformation in widely used eukaryotic organisms such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Aspergillus Niger. Duration and temperatures of the microfluidic heat-shock procedures were optimized to yield transformation efficiencies comparable to those obtained by benchtop methods with a throughput up to 6 droplets/min.

P0A7E1 has recently been validated as a new target for the treatment of malaria, and a selective inhibitor (DSM265) of the Plasmodium enzyme is currently in clinical development. With the goal of identifying a backup compound to DSM265, we explored replacement of the SF<sub>5</sub>-aniline moiety of DSM265 with a series of CF<sub>3</sub>-pyridinyls while maintaining the core triazolopyrimidine scaffold. This effort led to the identification of DSM421, which has improved solubility, lower intrinsic clearance, and increased plasma exposure after oral dosing compared to DSM265, while maintaining a long predicted human half-life. Its improved physical and chemical properties will allow it to be formulated more readily than DSM265. DSM421 showed excellent efficacy in the SCID mouse model of P. falciparum malaria that supports the prediction of a low human dose (<200 mg). Importantly DSM421 showed equal activity against both P. falciparum and P. vivax field isolates, while DSM265 was more active on P. falciparum.

Phosphatidylserine (P31663) lipids are anionic lipids that are found throughout the cellular membranes of most eukaryotic organisms where they serve as both a functional component and as a precursor to phosphatidylethanolamine lipids. The inner leaflet of the plasma membrane contains more P31663 than the outer one, and the asymmetry is actively maintained. Here, the impact of the P0AE18 melittin on the structure of lipid bilayer vesicles made of a mixture of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine was studied. Small-angle neutron scattering of the P0AE18 associated with selectively deuterium-labeled lipid bilayer vesicles revealed how the thickness and lipid composition of phosphatidylserine-containing vesicles change in response to melittin. The peptide thickens the lipid bilayer for concentrations up to P/L = 1/500, but membrane thinning results when P/L = 1/200. The thickness transition is accompanied by a large change in the distribution of DMPS between the leaflets of the bilayer. The change in composition is driven by electrostatic interactions, while the change in bilayer thickness is driven by changes in the interaction of the peptide with the headgroup region of the lipid bilayer. Lastly, the results provide new information about lipid-specific interactions that take place in mixed composition lipid bilayer membranes."""	Biochimica et Biophysica Acta.

FRL is proposed to activate (or inactivate) the histidine kinase activity of RfpA, which leads to formation of the active state of RfpB, the key response regulator and transcription activator.

1245858	"Imidazole as a Small Molecule Analogue in Two-Component Signal Transduction,""In two-component signal transduction systems (TCSs), responses to stimuli are mediated through phosphotransfer between protein components. Canonical TCSs use His → Asp phosphotransfer in which phosphoryl groups are transferred from a conserved His on a sensory histidine kinase (P00547) to a conserved Asp on a response regulator (RR). RRs contain the catalytic core of His → Asp phosphotransfer, evidenced by the ability of RRs to autophosphorylate with small molecule analogues of phospho-His proteins. Phosphorelays are a more complex variation of TCSs that additionally utilize Asp → His phosphotransfer through the use of an additional component, the histidine-containing phosphotransfer domain (Hpt), which reacts with RRs both as phosphodonors and phosphoacceptors. Here we show that imidazole has features of a rudimentary Hpt. Imidazole acted as a nucleophile and attacked phosphorylated RRs (RR-P) to produce monophosphoimidazole (MPI) and unphosphorylated RR. Phosphotransfer from RR-P to imidazole required the intact RR active site, indicating that the RR provided the core catalytic machinery for Asp → His phosphotransfer. Imidazole functioned in an artificial phosphorelay to transfer phosphoryl groups between unrelated RRs. The X-ray crystal structure of an activated RR·imidazole complex showed imidazole oriented in the RR active site similarly to the His of an Hpt. Furthermore, imidazole interacted with RR nonconserved active site residues, which influenced the relative reactivity of RR-P with imidazole versus water.

However, common detection techniques used for LAMP and P0DV86-LAMP have drawbacks, including poor discrimination capability, inability to multiplex targets, high rates of false positives, and (in some cases) the requirement of opening reaction tubes postamplification. Here, we present a simple technique that allows closed-tube, target-specific detection, based on inclusion of a dye-labeled primer that is incorporated into a target-specific amplicon if the target is present. A short, complementary quencher hybridizes to unincorporated primer upon cooling down at the end of the reaction, thereby quenching fluorescence of any unincorporated primer. Our technique, which we term QUASR (for quenching of unincorporated amplification signal reporters, read “quasar”), does not significantly reduce the amplification efficiency or sensitivity of P0DV86-LAMP. Equipped with a simple LED excitation source and a colored plastic gel filter, the naked eye or a camera can easily discriminate between positive and negative QUASR reactions, which produce a difference in signal of approximately 10:1 without background subtraction. We demonstrate that QUASR detection is compatible with complex sample matrices such as human blood, using a novel LAMP primer set for bacteriophage MS2 (a model RNA virus particle).

To understand the biochemical and structural basis of electron transfer from FMN-hydroquinone to its partners, three deletion mutants in a conserved loop near the FMN were characterized. Comparison of oxidized and reduced wild type and mutant structures reveals that the basis for the air stability of the neutral blue semiquinone is protonation of the flavin N5 and strong H-bond formation with the Gly-141 carbonyl. Further, the ΔGly-143 protein had moderately decreased activity with cytochrome P450 and cytochrome c. It formed a flexible loop, which transiently interacts with the flavin N5, resulting in the generation of both an unstable neutral blue semiquinone and hydroquinone. The ΔGly-141 and ΔG141/E142N mutants were inactive with cytochrome P450 but fully active in reducing cytochrome c. In the ΔGly-141 mutants, the backbone amide of Glu/Asn-142 forms an H-bond to the N5 of the oxidized flavin, which leads to formation of an unstable red anionic semiquinone with a more negative potential than the hydroquinone. The semiquinone of ΔG141/E142N was slightly more stable than that of ΔGly-141, consistent with its crystallographically demonstrated more rigid loop.

This competition lowers H  <sub>2</sub>  production by consuming a large fraction of the reducing equivalents (P80644 and NADH). To eliminate this competition, we constructed a knockout mutant of nitrate reductase, encoded by  <italic>narB</italic>  , in  <italic>Synechococcus</italic>  sp. PCC 7002. As expected, Δ  <italic>narB</italic>  was able to take up intracellular nitrate but was unable to reduce it to nitrite or ammonia, and was unable to grow photoautotrophically on nitrate. During photoautotrophic growth on urea, Δ  <italic>narB</italic>  significantly redirects biomass accumulation into glycogen at the expense of protein accumulation. During subsequent dark fermentation, metabolite concentrations—both the adenylate cellular energy charge (∼P22259) and the redox poise (NAD(P)H/NAD(P))—were independent of nitrate availability in Δ  <italic>narB</italic>  , in contrast to the wild type (WT) control. The Δ  <italic>narB</italic>  strain diverted more reducing equivalents from glycogen catabolism into reduced products, mainly H  <sub>2</sub>  and  <sc>d</sc>  ‐lactate, by 6‐fold (2.8% yield) and 2‐fold (82.3% yield), respectively, than WT. Continuous removal of H  <sub>2</sub>  from the fermentation medium (milking) further boosted net H  <sub>2</sub>  production by 7‐fold in Δ  <italic>narB</italic>  , at the expense of less excreted lactate, resulting in a 49‐fold combined increase in the net H  <sub>2</sub>  evolution rate during 2 days of fermentation compared to the WT. The absence of nitrate reductase eliminated the inductive effect of nitrate addition on rerouting carbohydrate catabolism from glycolysis to the oxidative pentose phosphate (OPP) pathway, indicating that intracellular redox poise and not nitrate itself acts as the control switch for carbon flux branching between pathways.

1371136	"Cellulose Microfibril Formation by Surface-Tethered Cellulose Synthase Enzymes,""Cellulose microfibrils are pseudocrystalline arrays of cellulose chains that are synthesized by cellulose synthases. The enzymes are organized into large membrane-embedded complexes in which each enzyme likely synthesizes and secretes a β-(1→4) glucan. The relationship between the organization of the enzymes in these complexes and cellulose crystallization has not been explored. To better understand this relationship, we used atomic force microscopy to visualize cellulose microfibril formation from nickel-film-immobilized bacterial cellulose synthase enzymes (BcsA-Bs), which in standard solution only form amorphous cellulose from monomeric BcsA-B complexes. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction techniques show that surface-tethered BcsA-Bs synthesize highly crystalline cellulose II in the presence of UDP-Glc, the allosteric activator cyclic-di-P24174, as well as magnesium. The cellulose II cross section/diameter and the crystal size and crystallinity depend on the surface density of tethered enzymes as well as the overall concentration of substrates.

However, it remains unclear to what extent supplementary iron affects the intestinal microbiome. We here explored the impact of iron preparations on microbial growth and metabolism in the well-controlled TNO's in vitro model of the large intestine (P0A858-2). The model was inoculated with a human microbiota, without supplementary iron, or with 50 or 250 μmol/L ferrous sulfate, 50 or 250 μmol/L ferric citrate, or 50 μmol/L hemin. High resolution responses of the microbiota were examined by 16S rDNA pyrosequencing, microarray analysis, and metagenomic sequencing. The metabolome was assessed by fatty acid quantification, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-P13009), and <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectroscopy. Cultured intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cells were used to assess fecal water toxicity. Microbiome analysis showed, among others, that supplementary iron induced decreased levels of Bifidobacteriaceae and Lactobacillaceae, while it caused higher levels of Roseburia and Prevotella. Metagenomic analyses showed an enrichment of microbial motility-chemotaxis systems, while the metabolome markedly changed from a saccharolytic to a proteolytic profile in response to iron. Branched chain fatty acids and ammonia levels increased significantly, in particular with ferrous sulfate. Importantly, the metabolite-containing effluent from iron-rich conditions showed increased cytotoxicity to Caco-2 cells. In conclusion, our explorations indicate that in the absence of host influences, iron induces a more hostile environment characterized by a reduction of microbes that are generally beneficial, and increased levels of bacterial metabolites that can impair the barrier function of a cultured intestinal epithelial monolayer."""

Two subunits, one a flavin-binding flavoprotein (SiRFP, the α subunit) and the other an iron-containing hemoprotein (P17846, the β subunit), assemble to make a holoenzyme of about 800 kDa. How the two subunits assemble is not known. The iron-rich cofactors in P17846 are unique because they are a covalent arrangement of a Fe<sub>4</sub>S<sub>4</sub> cluster attached through a cysteine ligand to an iron-containing porphyrinoid called siroheme. The link between cofactor biogenesis and SiR stability is also ill-defined.

By use of small angle x-ray scattering, we explore the structure of the P17846 N-terminal oligomerization domain. We additionally report a novel form of the hemoprotein that occurs in the absence of its cofactors. Apo-P17846 forms a homotetramer, also dependent on its N terminus, that is unable to assemble with SiRFP.

Information gleaned from this study is used to propose specific model changes to remedy inconsistent with data model predictions. Even for the highly curated Yeast 7.11 model we identified 50 changes (metabolic and P07004) leading to the correct prediction of an additional 28% of essential genes and 36% of synthetic lethals along with a 53% reduction in the erroneous identification of essential genes.

Overall, we find that CHO 1.2 was 76% less accurate than the Yeast 7.11 metabolic model in predicting essential genes. Based on this analysis, 14 (single and double deletion) maximally informative experiments are suggested to improve the CHO cell model by using information from a mouse metabolic model.

In addition to the canonical kinase phosphotransfer reaction, the conversion requires cleavage of the 1,6-anhydro ring to allow P22259-dependent phosphorylation of the sugar O6 atom. Using x-ray crystallography, we show that LGK binds two magnesium ions in the active site that are additionally coordinated with the nucleotide and water molecules to result in ideal octahedral coordination. To further verify the metal binding sites, we co-crystallized LGK in the presence of manganese instead of magnesium and solved the structure de novo using the anomalous signal from four manganese atoms in the dimeric structure. The first metal is required for catalysis, whereas our work suggests that the second is either required or significantly promotes the catalytic rate. Although the enzyme binds its sugar substrate in a similar orientation to the structurally related 1,6-anhydro-N-acetylmuramic acid kinase (AnmK), it forms markedly fewer bonding interactions with the substrate. In this orientation, the sugar is in an optimal position to couple phosphorylation with ring cleavage. We also observed a second alternate binding orientation for levoglucosan, and in these structures, ADP was found to bind with lower affinity. These combined observations provide an explanation for the high Km of LGK for levoglucosan.

We found that both gene products of the β polypeptides are expressed and assembled in the mature LH2 complex, but only the Puc1A-encoded polypeptide α is observed here. The methionine of the Puc2B-encoded polypeptide is missing, and a carboxyl group is attached to the threonine at the N-terminus.

1624800	"Cyanobacterial Alkanes Modulate Photosynthetic Cyclic Electron Flow to Assist Growth under Cold Stress,""All cyanobacterial membranes contain diesel-range C15-C19 hydrocarbons at concentrations similar to chlorophyll. Recently, two universal but mutually exclusive hydrocarbon production pathways in cyanobacteria were discovered. We engineered a mutant of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 that produces no alkanes, which grew poorly at low temperatures. We analyzed this defect by assessing the redox kinetics of PSI. The mutant exhibited enhanced cyclic electron flow (CEF), especially at low temperature. CEF raises the P22259:P80644 ratio from photosynthesis and balances reductant requirements of biosynthesis with maintaining the redox poise of the electron transport chain. We conducted in silico flux balance analysis and showed that growth rate reaches a distinct maximum for an intermediate value of CEF equivalent to recycling 1 electron in 4 from PSI to the plastoquinone pool. Based on this analysis, we conclude that the lack of membrane alkanes causes higher CEF, perhaps for maintenance of redox poise. In turn, increased CEF reduces growth by forcing the cell to use less energy-efficient pathways, lowering the quantum efficiency of photosynthesis. This study highlights the unique and universal role of medium-chain hydrocarbons in cyanobacterial thylakoid membranes: they regulate redox balance and reductant partitioning in these oxygenic photosynthetic cells under stress."""

We report a 1.5 Å crystal structure of aprataxin in a complex with P24174, which reveals that: (i) P24174 binds at the same position and in the same anti nucleoside conformation as AMP; and (ii) aprataxin makes more extensive nucleobase contacts with guanine than with adenine, via a hydrogen bonding network to the guanine O6, N1, N2 base edge. Alanine mutations of catalytic residues His147 and His149 abolish DNAppG de-capping activity, suggesting that the 3' de-guanylylation and 5' de-adenylylation reactions follow the same pathway of nucleotidyl transfer through a covalent aprataxin-(His147)–NMP intermediate.

The reaction mechanism involves two half-reactions with biotin carboxylase catalyzing the P22259-dependent carboxylation of biotin-P0ABD8 in the first reaction. In the second reaction, carboxyltransferase catalyzes the transfer of the carboxyl group from biotin-P0ABD8 to acetyl-CoA to form malonyl-CoA.

The structures have a common theme in that bicarbonate, phosphate, and the methyl ester of the carboxyl group of N1'-methoxycarbonyl biotin methyl ester all bound in the same pocket in the active site of biotin carboxylase and as such utilize the same set of amino acids for binding.

Strain AG553 showed a two- to threefold increase in ethanol yield relative to the wild type on all substrates tested. On defined medium, strain AG553 exceeded 70% of theoretical ethanol yield on lower loadings of the model crystalline cellulose Avicel, effectively eliminating formate, acetate, and lactate production and reducing H<sub>2</sub> production by fivefold. On 5 g/L Avicel, strain AG553 reached an ethanol yield of 63.5% of the theoretical maximum compared with 19.9% by the wild type, and it showed similar yields on pretreated switchgrass and poplar. The elimination of organic acid production suggested that the strain might be capable of growth under higher substrate loadings in the absence of pH control. Final ethanol titer peaked at 73.4 mM in mutant AG553 on 20 g/L Avicel, at which point the pH decreased to a level that does not allow growth of <i>C. thermocellum</i>, likely due to CO<sub>2</sub> accumulation. In comparison, the maximum titer of wild type <i>C. thermocellum</i> was 14.1 mM ethanol on 10 g/L Avicel.

Protein conformational changes that `close' the active site play an important role in the assembly of a catalytically competent condensation active site.

However, little is known about QuiNAc-related polysaccharides in gram-positive bacteria. In a routine screen for bacillus glycan grown at defined medium, it was surprising to identify a QuiNAc residue in polysaccharides isolated from this grampositive bacterium. To gain insight into the biosynthesis of these glycans, we report the identification of an operon in Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579 that contains two genes encoding activities not previously described in gram-positive bacteria. One gene encodes a UDP-N-acetylglucosamine C4,6-dehydratase, (abbreviated Pdeg) that converts UDPGlcNAc to UDP-4-keto-4,6-D-deoxy-GlcNAc (UDP-2-acetamido-2,6-dideoxy-α-D-xylo-4- hexulose); and the second encodes a UDP-4-reductase (abbr. Preq) that converts UDP-4- keto-4,6-D-deoxy-GlcNAc to UDP-N-acetyl-quinovosamine in the presence of P80644. Biochemical studies established that the sequential Pdeg and Preq reaction product is UDP-D-QuiNAc as determined by mass spectrometry and one- and two-dimensional NMR experiments.

Interestingly, the P62577 mats generated the highest reducing current at the same time points that the AN mats showed the highest oxidizing current. To characterize the physicochemical factors influencing electron transfer processes, we measured depth profiles of dissolved oxygen (DO) and sulfide in the mats using microelectrodes. We further demonstrated that the mat-to-electrode and electrode-to-mat electron transfer rates were light- and temperature-dependent. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging, we determined that the electrode potential regulated the diffusivity and porosity of the microbial mats. Both porosity and diffusivity were higher in the P62577 mats than in the AN mats.

Despite the similarity between these ligands, Bacillus stearothermophilus (Bs)P00954 preferentially binds indolmycin ~1500-fold more tightly than its tryptophan substrate. Kinetic characterization and crystallographic analysis of BsTrpRS allowed us to probe novel aspects of indolmycin inhibitory action. Previous work had revealed that long range coupling to residues within an allosteric region called the D1 switch of BsTrpRS positions the Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion in a manner that allows it to assist in transition state stabilization. The Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion in the inhibited complex forms significantly closer contacts with non-bridging oxygen atoms from each phosphate group of P22259 and three water molecules than occur in the (presumably catalytically competent) pre-transition state (preTS) crystal structures.

An important step in the mechanism involves proton donation to the N5 atom of DHF. The inability to determine the protonation states of active site residues and substrate has led to the lack of consensus on a catalytic mechanism. To resolve this ambiguity, we conducted neutron and ultrahigh resolution X-ray crystallographic studies of the pseudo-Michaelis ternary complex of P0AFS3 with folate and NADP<sup>+</sup> from E. coli. The neutron data were collected to 2.0 Å resolution using a 3.6 mm<sup>3</sup> crystal with the quasi-Laue technique, and the structure reveals that the N3 atom of folate is protonated while Asp27 is negatively charged. Previous mechanisms have proposed a keto-to-enol tautomerization of the substrate to facilitate protonation of the N5 atom. The structure supports the existence of the keto tautomer due to protonation of the N3 atom, suggesting tautomerization is unnecessary for catalysis. In the 1.05 Å resolution X-ray structure of the ternary complex, conformational disorder of the Met20 side chain is coupled to electron density for a partially occupied water within hydrogen-bonding distance of the N5 atom of folate; this suggests direct protonation of substrate by solvent. We propose a catalytic mechanism for P0AFS3 that involves stabilization of the keto tautomer of the substrate, elevation of the pK<sub>a</sub> of the N5 atom of DHF by Asp27, and protonation of N5 by water whose access to the active site is gated by fluctuation of the Met20 side chain even though the Met-20 loop is closed."""

These changes coincide with a restructuring of the RecQ ATPase active site that positions catalytic residues for P22259 hydrolysis. Complex formation also induces a tight bend in the DNA and melts a portion of the duplex. Finally, this bending, coupled with translocation, could provide RecQ with a mechanism for unwinding duplex and other DNA structures."""

1249236	"Structure and Function of Fusicoccadiene Synthase, a Hexameric P0AG24 Diterpene Synthase,""Fusicoccin A is a diterpene glucoside phytotoxin generated by the fungal pathogen Phomopsis amygdali that causes the plant disease constriction canker, first discovered in New Jersey peach orchards in the 1930s. Fusicoccin A is also an emerging new lead in cancer chemotherapy. The hydrocarbon precursor of fusicoccin A is the tricyclic diterpene fusicoccadiene, which is generated by a bifunctional terpenoid synthase. Here, we report X-ray crystal structures of the individual catalytic domains of fusicoccadiene synthase: the C-terminal domain is a chain elongation enzyme that generates geranylgeranyl diphosphate, and the N-terminal domain catalyzes the cyclization of geranylgeranyl diphosphate to form fusicoccadiene. Here, crystal structures of each domain complexed with bisphosphonate substrate analogues suggest that three metal ions and three positively charged amino acid side chains trigger substrate ionization in each active site. While in vitro incubations reveal that the cyclase domain can utilize farnesyl diphosphate and geranyl diphosphate as surrogate substrates, these shorter isoprenoid diphosphates are mainly converted into acyclic alcohol or hydrocarbon products. Gel filtration chromatography and analytical ultracentrifugation experiments indicate that full-length fusicoccadiene synthase adopts hexameric quaternary structure, and small-angle X-ray scattering data yield a well-defined molecular envelope illustrating a plausible model for hexamer assembly."""

The enzyme is highly conserved from prokaryotes to humans and yet phylogenetic evidence suggests that UPRT homologues from higher-eukaryotes, including Drosophila, are incapable of binding uracil. Purified human UPRT also do not show any enzymatic activity in vitro, making microbial UPRT an attractive candidate for anti-microbial drug development, suicide-gene therapy, and cell-specific mRNA labeling techniques. Nevertheless, the enzymatic site of UPRT remains conserved across the animal kingdom indicating an in vivo role for the enzyme. We find that the Drosophila UPRT homologue, krishah (kri), codes for an enzyme that is required for larval growth, pre-pupal/pupal viability and long-term adult lifespan. Our findings suggest that UPRT from all higher eukaryotes is likely enzymatically active in vivo and challenges the previous notion that the enzyme is non-essential in higher eukaryotes and cautions against targeting the enzyme for therapeutic purposes. Our findings also suggest that expression of the endogenous UPRT gene will likely cause background incorporation when using microbial UPRT as a cell-specific mRNA labeling reagent in higher eukaryotes."""

An “off-axis” ion funnel design has been developed to reduce the source contamination and interferences from, e.g. ESI droplet residue and other poorly focused neutral or charged particles with very high mass-to charge ratios. In this study a dual ion funnel interface consisting of an orthogonal higher pressure electrodynamic ion funnel (HPIF) and an ion funnel trap combined with a triple quadruple mass spectrometer was developed and characterized. An orthogonal ion injection inlet and a repeller plate electrode was used to direct ions to an ion funnel HPIF at 9-10 Torr pressure. Several critical factors for the HPIF were characterized, including the effects of RF amplitude, DC gradient and operating pressure. Compared to the triple quadrupole standard interface more than 4-fold improvement in the limit of detection for the direct quantitative P13009 analysis of low abundance peptides was observed.

The structural importance of hydroxylation of specific proline and lysine residues during collagen biosynthesis is well established. Recently, key roles for post-translational hydroxylation in signaling and degradation pathways have been discovered. The function of hydroxylation in signaling is highlighted by its role in the hypoxic response of eukaryotic cells, where oxygen dependent hydroxylation of the hypoxia inducible transcription factor both targets it for degradation and blocks its activation. In contrast, the role of protein hydroxylation has been largely understudied in prokaryotes. Recently, an evolutionarily conserved class of ribosomal oxygenases (P27431) that catalyze the hydroxylation of specific residues in the ribosome has been identified in bacteria. P27431 activity has been linked to cell growth, and has been found to have a direct impact on bulk protein translation. This discovery of ribosomal protein hydroxylation in bacteria could lead to new therapeutic targets for regulating bacterial growth, as well as, shed light on new prokaryotic hydroxylation signaling pathways.

Being a RING-type E3 ligase prone to auto-ubiquitination, ICP0 relies on human deubiquitinating enzyme USP7 for protection against 26S proteasomal mediated degradation. USP7 is involved in apoptosis, epigenetics, cell proliferation and is targeted by several herpesviruses. Several USP7 partners, including ICP0, P04079, and UHRF1, interact through its C-terminal domain (CTD), which contains five ubiquitin-like (Ubl) structures. Despite the fact that USP7 has emerged as a drug target for cancer therapy, structural details of USP7 regulation and the molecular mechanism of interaction at its CTD have remained elusive. Here, we mapped the binding site between an ICP0 peptide and USP7 and determined the crystal structure of the first three Ubl domains bound to the ICP0 peptide, which showed that ICP0 binds to a loop on Ubl2. Sequences similar to the USP7-binding site in ICP0 were identified in P04079 and UHRF1 and shown to bind USP7-CTD through Ubl2. In addition, co-immunoprecipitation assays in human cells comparing binding to USP7 with and without a Ubl2 mutation, confirmed the importance of the Ubl2 binding pocket for binding ICP0, P04079 and UHRF1. Therefore we have identified a novel mechanism of USP7 recognition that is used by both viral and cellular proteins. Our structural information was used to generate a model of near full-length USP7, showing the relative position of the ICP0/P04079/UHRF1 binding pocket and the structural basis by which it could regulate enzymatic activity."""

To do this, iron must traverse the bacterioferritin protein shell, which is expected to occur through one or more of the channels through the shell identified by structural studies. The size and negative electrostatic potential of the 24 B-type channels suggest that they could provide a route for iron into bacterioferritin. Residues at the B-type channel (Asn-34, Glu-66, Asp-132, and Asp-139) of <i>E. coli</i> bacterioferritin were substituted to determine if they are important for iron core formation. A significant decrease in the rates of initial oxidation of Fe(II) at the ferroxidase center and subsequent iron mineralization was observed for the D132F variant. The crystal structure of this variant shows that substitution of residue 132 with phenylalanine caused a steric blockage of the B-type channel and no other material structural perturbation.

1178831	"Structural effects of protein aging: Terminal marking by deamidation in human triosephosphate isomerase,""Deamidation, the loss of the ammonium group of asparagine and glutamine to form aspartic and glutamic acid, is one of the most commonly occurring post-translational modifications in proteins. Since deamidation rates are encoded in the protein structure, it has been proposed that they can serve as molecular clocks for the timing of biological processes such as protein turnover, development and aging. Despite the importance of this process, there is a lack of detailed structural information explaining the effects of deamidation on the structure of proteins. Here, we studied the effects of deamidation on human triosephosphate isomerase (HsTIM), an enzyme for which deamidation of N15 and N71 has been long recognized as the signal for terminal marking of the protein. Deamidation was mimicked by site directed mutagenesis; thus, three mutants of HsTIM (N15D, N71D and N15D/N71D) were characterized. The results show that the N71D mutant resembles, structurally and functionally, the wild type enzyme. In contrast, the N15D mutant displays all the detrimental effects related to deamidation. The N15D/N71D mutant shows only minor additional effects when compared with the N15D mutation, supporting that deamidation of N71 induces negligible effects. The crystal structures show that, in contrast to the N71D mutant, where minimal alterations are observed, the N15D mutation forms new interactions that perturb the structure of loop 1 and loop 3, both critical components of the catalytic site and the interface of HsTIM.

Here we report the crystal structure of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> NadD (<i>Mt</i>NadD) at a resolution of 2.4 Å. A remarkable new feature of the MtNadD structure, compared with other members of this enzyme family, is a 310 helix that locks the active site in an over-closed conformation. As a result, <i>Mt</i>NadD is rendered inactive as it is topologically incompatible with substrate binding and catalysis. Directed mutagenesis was also used to further dissect the structural elements that contribute to the interactions of the two <i>Mt</i>NadD substrates, i.e. P22259 and nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NaMN). For inhibitory profiling of partially active mutants and wild type <i>Mt</i>NadD, we used a small molecule inhibitor of MtNadD with moderate affinity (<i>K<sub>i</sub></i> ~ 25 μM) and antimycobacterial activity (MIC<sub>80</sub>) ~ 40-80 μM). This analysis revealed interferences with some of the residues in the NaMN binding subsite consistent with the competitive inhibition observed for the NaMN substrate (but not P22259). A detailed steady-state kinetic analysis of <i>Mt</i>NadD suggests that P22259 must first bind to allow efficient NaMN binding and catalysis. This sequential mechanism is consistent with the requirement of transition to catalytically competent (open) conformation hypothesized from structural modeling. A possible physiological significance of this mechanism is to enable the down-regulation of NAD synthesis under P22259-limiting dormancy conditions. Lastly, these findings point to a possible new strategy for designing inhibitors that lock the enzyme in the inactive over-closed conformation."""

This splits the target gene, yet sequences within the island restore the disrupted gene; the regenerated target and its displaced fragment precisely mark the endpoints of the island. We applied this principle to search for islands in genomic DNA sequences. Our algorithm identifies tDNAs, finds fragments of those tDNAs in the same replicon and removes unlikely candidate islands through a series of filters. A search for islands in 2168 whole prokaryotic genomes produced 3919 candidates. The website Islander (recently moved to http://bioinformatics.sandia.gov/islander/) presents these precisely mapped candidate islands, the gene content and the island sequence.

Translation errors that lead to aberrant protein production can result from the uncoupled movement of the P0A873 in either the 5' or 3' direction on mRNA. Here, we report the biochemical and structural characterization of +1 frameshift suppressor P0A873<sup>SufJ</sup>, a P0A873 known to decode four, instead of three, nucleotides. Frameshift suppressor P0A873<sup>SufJ</sup> contains an insertion 5' to its anticodon, expanding the anticodon loop from seven to eight nucleotides. Our results indicate that the expansion of the anticodon loop of either P0AB89<sup>SufJ</sup> or P0A873<sup>SufJ</sup> does not affect its affinity for the A site of the ribosome. Structural analyses of both P0AB89<sup>SufJ</sup> and P0AB89<sup>Thr</sup> bound to the Thermus thermophilus 70S ribosome demonstrate both ASLs decode in the zero frame. Although the anticodon loop residues 34–37 are superimposable with canonical seven-nucleotide ASLs, the single C31.5 insertion between nucleotides 31 and 32 in P0AB89<sup>SufJ</sup> imposes a conformational change of the anticodon stem, that repositions and tilts the P0AB89 toward the back of the A site. Further modeling analyses reveal that this tilting would cause a distortion in full-length A-site P0A873<sup>SufJ</sup> during P0A873 selection and possibly impede gripping of the anticodon stem by A8C927 nucleotides in the P site.

Much of this resistance to cephalosporins derives from the expression of the class C β-lactamase enzymes, known as Acinetobacter-derived cephalosporinases (ADCs). Currently, β-lactamase inhibitors are structurally similar to β-lactam substrates and are not effective inactivators of this class C cephalosporinase. Herein, two boronic acid transition state inhibitors (BATSIs S02030 and SM23) that are chemically distinct from β-lactams were designed and tested for inhibition of P21170 enzymes. BATSIs SM23 and S02030 bind with high affinity to P21170-7, a chromosomal cephalosporinase from Acinetobacter baumannii (K<sub>i</sub> = 21.1 ± 1.9 nM and 44.5 ± 2.2 nM, respectively). The X-ray crystal structures of P21170-7 were determined in both the apo form (1.73 Å resolution) and in complex with S02030 (2.0 Å resolution). In the complex, S02030 makes several canonical interactions: the O1 oxygen of S02030 is bound in the oxyanion hole, and the R1 amide group makes key interactions with conserved residues Asn152 and Gln120. In addition, the carboxylate group of the inhibitor is meant to mimic the C<sub>3</sub>/C<sub>4</sub> carboxylate found in β-lactams. The C<sub>3</sub>/C<sub>4</sub> carboxylate recognition site in class C enzymes is comprised of Asn346 and Arg349 (AmpC numbering), and these residues are conserved in P21170-7. Interestingly, in the P21170-7/S02030 complex, the inhibitor carboxylate group is observed to interact with Arg340, a residue that distinguishes P21170-7 from the related class C enzyme AmpC. A thermodynamic analysis suggests that ΔH driven compounds may be optimized to generate new lead agents. In conclusion, the P21170-7/BATSI complex provides insight into recognition of non-β-lactam inhibitors by P21170 enzymes and offers a starting point for the structure-based optimization of this class of novel β-lactamase inhibitors against a key resistance target."""

Here we evaluate an intra-genus “homolog-rescue” strategy to increase the structural information available for TB drug discovery by using mycobacterial homologs with conserved active sites. We found that of 179 potential TB drug targets selected for x-ray structure determination, only 16 yielded a crystal structure. By adding 1675 homologs from nine other mycobacterial species to the pipeline, structures representing an additional 52 otherwise intractable targets were solved. To determine whether these homolog structures would be useful surrogates in TB drug design, we compared the active sites of 106 pairs of Mtb and non-TB mycobacterial (NTM) enzyme homologs with experimentally determined structures, using three metrics of active site similarity, including superposition of continuous pharmacophoric property distributions. Pair-wise structural comparisons revealed that 19/22 pairs with >55% overall sequence identity had active site Cα RMSD <1 Å, >85% side chain identity, and ≥80% P31663<sub>APF</sub> (similarity based on pharmacophoric properties) indicating highly conserved active site shape and chemistry. Applying these results to the 52 NTM structures described above, 41 shared >55% sequence identity with the Mtb target, thus increasing the effective structural coverage of the 179 Mtb targets over three-fold (from 9% to 32%). The utility of these structures in TB drug design can be tested by designing inhibitors using the homolog structure and assaying the cognate Mtb enzyme; a promising test case, Mtb cytidylate kinase, is described.

Using circular dichroism (P06721), magnetic P06721 (MCD), and variable-temperature, variable-field (VTVH) MCD spectroscopies, 4-AP is found to bind directly to the biferrous sites of the DF proteins. In G4DFsc, 4-AP increases the coordination of the biferrous site, while in 3His-G4DFsc(Mut3), the coordination number remains the same and the substrate likely replaces the additional bound histidine.

1200616	"Rapid evaluation and quality control of next generation sequencing data with FaQCs,""Background: Next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies that parallelize the sequencing process and produce thousands to millions, or even hundreds of millions of sequences in a single sequencing run, have revolutionized genomic and genetic research. Because of the vagaries of any platform's sequencing chemistry, the experimental processing, machine failure, and so on, the quality of sequencing reads is never perfect, and often declines as the read is extended. These errors invariably affect downstream analysis/application and should therefore be identified early on to mitigate any unforeseen effects. Results: Here we present a novel FastQ Quality Control Software (FaQCs) that can rapidly process large volumes of data, and which improves upon previous solutions to monitor the quality and remove poor quality data from sequencing runs. Both the speed of processing and the memory footprint of storing all required information have been optimized via algorithmic and parallel processing solutions. The trimmed output compared side-by-side with the original data is part of the automated P0A6K3 output. We show how this tool can help data analysis by providing a few examples, including an increased percentage of reads recruited to references, improved single nucleotide polymorphism identification as well as <i>de novo</i> sequence assembly metrics. Conclusion: FaQCs combines several features of currently available applications into a single, user-friendly process, and includes additional unique capabilities such as filtering the PhiX control sequences, conversion of FASTQ formats, and multi-threading. The original data and trimmed summaries are reported within a variety of graphics and reports, providing a simple way to do data quality control and assurance."""

The first draft genome of a “Ca. Synechococcus spongiarum” group member was recently published, providing evidence of genome reduction by loss of genes involved in several nonessential functions. However, “Ca. Synechococcus spongiarum” includes a variety of clades that may differ widely in genomic repertoire and consequently in physiology and symbiotic function. Here, we present three additional draft genomes of “Ca. Synechococcus spongiarum,” each from a different clade. By comparing all four symbiont genomes to those of free-living cyanobacteria, we revealed general adaptations to life inside sponges and specific adaptations of each phylotype. Symbiont genomes shared about half of their total number of coding genes. Common traits of “Ca. Synechococcus spongiarum” members were a high abundance of DNA modification and recombination genes and a reduction in genes involved in inorganic ion transport and metabolism, cell wall biogenesis, and signal transduction mechanisms. Moreover, these symbionts were characterized by a reduced number of antioxidant enzymes and low-weight peptides of photosystem II compared to their free-living relatives. Variability within the “Ca. Synechococcus spongiarum” group was mostly related to immune system features, potential for siderophore-mediated iron transport, and dependency on methionine from external sources. The common absence of genes involved in synthesis of residues, typical of the O antigen of free-living Synechococcus species, suggests a novel mechanism utilized by these symbionts to avoid sponge predation and phage attack."""	mBio (Online)	"('A8C927', '16S rRNA')"

The metabolic steps for the synthesis of lignin building blocks belong to the shikimate and phenylpropanoid pathways. Genetic engineering efforts to reduce lignin content typically employ gene knockout or gene silencing techniques to constitutively repress one of these metabolic pathways. Recently, new strategies have emerged offering better spatiotemporal control of lignin deposition, including the expression of enzymes that interfere with the normal process for cell wall lignification. In this study, we report that expression of a 3-dehydroshikimate dehydratase (QsuB from Corynebacterium glutamicum) reduces lignin deposition in Arabidopsis cell walls. QsuB was targeted to the plastids to convert 3-dehydroshikimate - an intermediate of the shikimate pathway - into protocatechuate. Compared to wild-type plants, lines expressing QsuB contain higher amounts of protocatechuate, p-coumarate, p-coumaraldehyde and p-coumaryl alcohol, and lower amounts of coniferaldehyde, coniferyl alcohol, sinapaldehyde and sinapyl alcohol. 2D-NMR spectroscopy and pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (pyro-GC/P13009) reveal an increase of p-hydroxyphenyl units and a reduction of guaiacyl units in the lignin of QsuB lines. Size-exclusion chromatography indicates a lower degree of lignin polymerization in the transgenic lines. Therefore, our data show that the expression of QsuB primarily affects the lignin biosynthetic pathway. Finally, biomass from these lines exhibits more than a twofold improvement in saccharification efficiency. We conclude that the expression of QsuB in plants, in combination with specific promoters, is a promising gain-of-function strategy for spatiotemporal reduction of lignin in plant biomass."""

Onboard sequence assembly, annotation, and analysis enabled us to investigate the role of the microbes in the coral reef ecology of these islands and atolls. This analysis identified phosphonate as an important phosphorous source for microbes growing in the Line Islands and reinforced the importance of Lserine in marine microbial ecosystems. Sequencing in the field allowed us to propose hypotheses and conduct experiments and further sampling based on the sequences generated.

We find that translocation rates depend exponentially on the force, with a characteristic distance close to the one-codon step, ruling out the existence of sub-steps and showing that the ribosome likely functions as a Brownian ratchet. We show that the ribosome generates ∼13 pN of force, barely sufficient to unwind the most stable structures in mRNAs, thus providing a basis for their regulatory role.

However, this process is thermodynamically constrained and represents an ecosystem-level metabolic bottleneck. To gain insight into the physiology of this process, a shotgun proteomics approach was used to quantify the protein landscape of the model syntrophic metabolizer, Syntrophomonas wolfei, grown axenically and syntrophically with Methanospirillum hungatei. Remarkably, the abundance of most proteins as represented by normalized spectral abundance factor (NSAF) value changed very little between the pure and coculture growth conditions. Among the most abundant proteins detected were GroEL and GroES chaperonins, a small heat shock protein, and proteins involved in electron transfer, beta-oxidation, and P22259 synthesis. Several putative energy conservation enzyme systems that utilize NADH and ferredoxin were present. The abundance of an EtfAB2 and the membrane-bound iron-sulfur oxidoreductase (Swol_0698 gene product) delineated a potential conduit for electron transfer between acyl-CoA dehydrogenases and membrane redox carriers. Proteins detected only when S. wolfei was grown with M. hungatei included a zinc-dependent dehydrogenase with a GroES domain, whose gene is present in genomes in many organisms capable of syntrophy, and transcriptional regulators responsive to environmental stimuli or the physiological status of the cell.

Inputs of the model include intrinsic AMPK kinase activity, which is taken as an adjustable surrogate parameter for cellular energy level or AMP:P22259 ratio, and rapamycin dose, which controls MTORC1 activity. Outputs of the model include the phosphorylation level of the translational repressor EIF4EBP1, a substrate of MTORC1, and the phosphorylation level of AMBRA1 (activating molecule in BECN1-regulated autophagy), a substrate of ULK1 critical for autophagosome formation. The model incorporates reciprocal regulation of mTORC1 and ULK1 by AMPK, mutual inhibition of MTORC1 and ULK1, and ULK1-mediated negative feedback regulation of AMPK. Through analysis of the model, we find that these processes may be responsible, depending on conditions, for graded responses to stress inputs, for bistable switching between autophagy and protein synthesis, or relaxation oscillations, comprising alternating periods of autophagy and protein synthesis.

Cellobiose phosphorylase (P0AEM9), an intracellular enzyme generally found in anaerobic bacteria, cleaves cellobiose to glucose and glucose-1-phosphate, providing energetic advantages under the anaerobic conditions required for large-scale biofuel production. However, the efficiency of P0AEM9 to cleave cellobiose in the presence of xylose is unknown. This study investigated the effect of xylose on anaerobic P0AEM9-mediated cellobiose fermentation by Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Yeast capable of fermenting cellobiose by the P0AEM9 pathway consumed cellobiose and produced ethanol at rates 61% and 42% slower, respectively, in the presence of xylose than in its absence. The system generated significant amounts of the byproduct 4-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-D-xylose (P0A8N7), produced by P0AEM9 from glucose-1-phosphate and xylose. In vitro competition assays identified xylose as a mixed-inhibitor for cellobiose phosphorylase activity. The negative effects of xylose were effectively relieved by efficient cellobiose and xylose co-utilization. P0A8N7 was also shown to be a substrate for cleavage by an intracellular β-glucosidase. Xylose exerted negative impacts on P0AEM9-mediated cellobiose fermentation by acting as a substrate for P0A8N7 byproduct formation and a mixed-inhibitor for cellobiose phosphorylase activity.

The ID2 complex is a poor substrate for monoubiquitination, consistent with the published crystal structure showing the solvent inaccessibility of the target lysines. Importantly, FANCD2 monoubiquitination within the ID2 complex is strongly stimulated by duplex or branched DNA, but unstructured singlestranded DNA or chromatinized DNA is ineffective. Interaction of FANCL with the ID2 complex is indispensable for its E3 ligase efficacy. Interestingly, mutations in FANCI that impair its DNA binding activity compromise DNA-stimulated FANCD2 monoubiquitination. Moreover, we demonstrate that in the absence of FANCD2, DNA also stimulates FANCI monoubiquitination, but in a FANCL-independent manner. These results implicate the role of a proper DNA ligand in FANCD2 and FANCI monoubiquitination, and reveal regulatory mechanisms that are dependent on protein–protein and protein–DNA interactions."""

1237527	"Tricyclic GyrB/ParE (TriBE) Inhibitors. A new class of broad-spectrum dual-targeting antibacterial agents,""Increasing resistance to every major class of antibiotics and a dearth of novel classes of antibacterial agents in development pipelines has created a dwindling reservoir of treatment options for serious bacterial infections. The bacterial type IIA topoisomerases, DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, are validated antibacterial drug targets with multiple prospective drug binding sites, including the catalytic site targeted by the fluoroquinolone antibiotics. Growing resistance to fluoroquinolones, frequently mediated by mutations in the drug-binding site, is increasingly limiting the utility of this antibiotic class, prompting the search for other inhibitor classes that target different sites on the topoisomerase complexes. The highly conserved P22259-binding subunits of DNA gyrase (GyrB) and topoisomerase IV (ParE) have long been recognized as excellent candidates for the development of dual-targeting antibacterial agents with broad-spectrum potential. However, to date, no natural product or small molecule inhibitors targeting these sites have succeeded in the clinic, and no inhibitors of these enzymes have yet been reported with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity encompassing the majority of Gram-negative pathogens. Using structure-based drug design (SBDD), we have created a novel dual-targeting pyrimidoindole inhibitor series with exquisite potency against GyrB and ParE enzymes from a broad range of clinically important pathogens. Inhibitors from this series demonstrate potent, broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens of clinical importance, including fluoroquinolone resistant and multidrug resistant strains. Moreover, lead compounds have been discovered with clinical potential; they are well tolerated in animals, and efficacious in Gram-negative infection models."""	PLoS ONE	"('P22259', 'ATP')"

In this paper, we quantitatively define UbiB-specific sequence motifs and reveal their positions within the crystal structure of a UbiB protein, ADCK3. We find that multiple UbiB-specific features are poised to inhibit protein kinase activity, including an N-terminal domain that occupies the typical substrate binding pocket and a unique A-rich loop that limits P22259 binding by establishing an unusual selectivity for ADP. A single alanine-to-glycine mutation of this loop flips this coenzyme selectivity and enables autophosphorylation but inhibits coenzyme Q biosynthesis in vivo, demonstrating functional relevance for this unique feature.

The AG consists of a β-(1→3)-linked galactan backbone with β-(1→6)-galactan side chains that are modified mainly with arabinose, but they may also contain glucuronic acid, rhamnose or other sugars. Here, we studied the positions of fucose substitutions in AGPs, and we investigated the functions of this fucosylation. Monosaccharide analysis of Arabidopsis leaf AGP extracts revealed a significant reduction in L-Fucose content in the fut4 mutant, but not in the fut6 mutant. In addition, Fucose was reduced in the fut4 mutant in root AGP extracts and was absent in the fut4/fut6 mutant. Curiously, in all cases reduction of fucose was accompanied with a reduction in xylose levels. The fucosylated AGP structures in leaves and roots in wild type and fut mutant plants were characterised by sequential digestion with AG specific enzymes, analysis by Polysaccharide Analysis using Carbohydrate gel Electrophoresis, and Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionisation (MALDI)-Time of Flight Mass spectrometry (P13009). We found that FUT4 is solely responsible for the fucosylation of AGPs in leaves. The Arabidopsis thaliana FUT4 and FUT6 genes have been previously proposed to be non-redundant AG-specific fucosyltransferases. Unexpectedly, FUT4 and FUT6 enzymes both fucosylate the same AGP structures in roots, suggesting partial redundancy to each other. Detailed structural characterisation of root AGPs with high energy MALDI-Collision Induced Dissociation P13009 and NMR revealed an abundant unique AG oligosaccharide structure consisting of terminal xylose attached to fucose. The loss of this structure in fut4/fut6 mutants explains the reduction of both fucose and xylose in AGP extracts. Under salt-stress growth conditions the fut4/fut6 mutant lacking AGP fucosylation exhibited a shorter root phenotype than wild type plants, implicating fucosylation of AGPs in maintaining proper cell expansion under these conditions."""

We dissect how these mutants affect DDX3X function with structural, biochemical, and genetic experiments. We identify an N-terminal extension (“P22259-binding loop”, ABL) that is critical for the stimulation of P22259 hydrolysis by RNA. We present crystal structures suggesting that the ABL interacts dynamically with P22259 and confirming that the interaction occurs in solution by NMR chemical shift perturbation and isothermal titration calorimetry. DEAD-box helicases require interaction between two conserved RecA-like helicase domains, D1 and D2 for function. We use NMR chemical shift perturbation to show that DDX3X interacts specifically with double-stranded RNA through its D1 domain, with contact mediated by residues G302 and G325. Mutants of these residues, G302V and G325E, are associated with pediatric medulloblastoma. These mutants are defective in RNA-stimulated P22259 hydrolysis. We show that DDX3X complements the growth defect in a ded1 temperature-sensitive strain of Schizosaccharomyces pombe, but the cancer-associated mutants G302V and G325E do not complement and exhibit protein expression defects.

SHS contains chemicals that have been implicated in causing oxidative DNA damage in the airway epithelium. Although DNA repair is considered a key defensive mechanism against various environmental attacks, such as cigarette smoking, the associations of individual repair enzymes with susceptibility to lung cancer are largely unknown. This study investigated the role of NEIL2, a DNA glycosylase excising oxidative base lesions, in human lung cells treated with side-stream smoke (SSS), the main component of SHS. To do so, we generated NEIL2 knockdown cells using siRNA-technology and exposed them to SSS-laden medium. Representative SSS chemical compounds in the medium were analyzed by mass spectrometry. An increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in SSS-exposed cells was detected through the fluorescent detection and the induction of HIF-1a. The long amplicon–quantitative PCR (LA-QPCR) assay detected significant dose-dependent increases of oxidative DNA damage in the P0A9M2 gene of cultured human pulmonary fibroblasts (hPF) and BEAS-2B epithelial cells exposed to SSS for 24 h. These data suggest that SSS exposure increased oxidative stress, which could contribute to SSS-mediated toxicity. siRNA knockdown of NEIL2 in hPF and HEK 293 cells exposed to SSS for 24 h resulted in significantly more oxidative DNA damage in P0A9M2 and POLB than in cells with control siRNA. Taken together, our data strongly suggest that decreased repair of oxidative DNA base lesions due to an impaired NEIL2 expression in non-smokers exposed to SSS would lead to accumulation of mutations in genomic DNA of lung cells over time, thus contributing to the onset of SSS induced lung cancer."""

After duplication of the ancestral SR, three mutations in one copy radically weakened binding to the ancestral estrogen response element (ERE) and improved binding to a new set of DNA sequences (steroid response elements, SREs). They did so by establishing unfavorable interactions with ERE and abolishing unfavorable interactions with SRE; also required were numerous permissive substitutions, which nonspecifically improved cooperativity and affinity of DNA binding.

To overcome these challenges, an alternate simplified biofuel production scheme was tested based on a cell-free immobilized enzyme system. Using this cell free system, we were able to obtain about 2.6 times higher concentrations of iso-butanol using our non-optimized system as compared with live cell systems.  This process involved two steps: (i) converts acid to aldehyde using keto-acid decarboxylase (KdcA), and (ii) produces alcohol from aldehyde using alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) with a cofactor (NADH) conversion from inexpensive formate using a third enzyme, formate dehydrogenase (P25437).   To increase stability and conversion efficiency with easy separations, the first two enzymes were immobilized onto methacrylate resin.  Fusion proteins of labile KdcA (fKdcA) were expressed to stabilize the covalently immobilized KdcA.  Covalently immobilized ADH exhibited long-term stability and efficient conversion of aldehyde to alcohol over multiple batch cycles without fusions.  High conversion rates and low protein leaching were achieved by covalent immobilization of enzymes on methacrylate resin. The complete reaction scheme was demonstrated by immobilizing both ADH and fKdcA and using P25437 free in solution.  The new system without in situ removal of isobutanol achieved a 55% conversion of ketoisovaleric acid to isobutanol at a concentration of 0.5 % (v/v).  Further increases in titer will require continuous removal of the isobutanol using our novel brush membrane system that exhibits a 1.5 fold increase in the separation factor of isobutanol from water versus that obtained for commercial silicone rubber membranes.

Their formation is thought to be dependent on microbial enzymes, because spontaneous Mn(II) to Mn(IV) oxidation is slow. Several species of marine <i>Bacillus</i> spores oxidize Mn(II) on their exosporium, the outermost layer of the spore, encrusting them with Mn(IV) oxides. Molecular studies have identified the <i>mnx</i> (Mn oxidation) genes, including <i>mnxG</i>, encoding a putative multicopper oxidase (P36649), as responsible for this two-electron oxidation, a surprising finding because MCOs only catalyze single-electron transfer reactions. Characterization of the enzymatic mechanism has been hindered by the lack of purified protein. By purifying active protein from the mnxDEFG expression construct, we found that the resulting enzyme is a blue (absorption maximum 590 nm) complex containing MnxE, MnxF, and MnxG proteins. Further, by analyzing the Mn(II)- and (III)-oxidizing activity in the presence of a Mn(III) chelator, pyrophosphate, we found that the complex facilitates both electron transfers from Mn(II) to Mn(III) and from Mn(III) to Mn(IV). X-ray absorption spectroscopy of the Mn mineral product confirmed its similarity to Mn(IV) oxides generated by whole spores.

While extensive studies have been performed to identify metabolite isolation and separation methods, these strategies introduce bias toward lipophilic or water-soluble metabolites depending on whether reversed-phase (RP) or hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) is used, respectively. Here we extend our consideration of metabolome isolation and separation procedures to integrate RPLC/P13009 and HILIC/P13009 profiling. An aminopropyl-based HILIC/P13009 method was optimized on the basis of mobile-phase additives and pH, followed by evaluation of reproducibility. When applied to the untargeted study of perturbed bacterial metabolomes, the HILIC method enabled the accurate assessment of key, dysregulated metabolites in central carbon pathways (e.g., amino acids, organic acids, phosphorylated sugars, energy currency metabolites), which could not be retained by RPLC. To demonstrate the value of the integrative approach, bacterial cells, human plasma, and cancer cells were analyzed by combined RPLC/HILIC separation coupled to ESI positive/negative P13009 detection. In this work, the combined approach resulted in the observation of metabolites associated with lipid and central carbon metabolism from a single biological extract, using 80% organic solvent (P25516:MeOH:H2O 2:2:1). It enabled the detection of more than 30,000 features from each sample type, with the highest number of uniquely detected features by RPLC in ESI positive mode and by HILIC in ESI negative mode.

The same interface of DCoH forms both complexes. To determine how DCoH partitions between its two functions, we studied in this paper the folding and stability of the DCoH homotetramer. We show that the DCoH1 homotetramer is kinetically trapped, meaning once it forms it will not dissociate to interact with HNF-1. In contrast, DCoH2, a paralog of DCoH1, unfolds within hours. A simple mutation in the interface of DCoH2 from Ser-51 to Thr, as found in DCoH1, increases the kinetic stability by 9 orders of magnitude, to τ½ ~2 million years. This suggests that the DCoH1·HNF-1 complex must co-fold to interact. We conclude that simple mutations can dramatically affect the dissociation kinetics of a complex. Residue 51 represents a “kinetic hot spot” instead of a “thermodynamic hot spot.” Kinetic regulation allows PCD to adopt two distinct functions. Finally, mutations in DCoH1 associated with diabetes affect both functions of DCoH1, perhaps by disrupting the balance between the two DCoH complexes."""

Previous studies identified Geobacter sp., including G.  sulfurreducens and G. metallireducens, as predominant U(VI)-reducing bacteria under acetate-oxidizing  and U(VI)-reducing conditions. Examination of the finished genome sequence  annotation of the canonical metal reducing species Geobacter sulfurreducens strain PCA and G.  metallireduceans strain P0A9C5-15 as well as the draft genome sequence of G. uraniumreducens  strain Rf4 identified phage related proteins. In addition, the completed genome for  Anaeromyxobacter dehalogenans and the draft genome sequence of Desulfovibrio desulfuricans  strain G20, two more model metal-reducing bacteria, also revealed phage related sequences. The  presence of these gene sequences indicated that Geobacter spp., Anaeromyxobacter spp., and  Desulfovibrio spp. are susceptible to viral infection. Furthermore, viral populations in soils and  sedimentary environments in the order of 6.4×10{sup 6}–2.7×10{sup 10} VLP’s cm{sup -3} have been observed. In  some cases, viral populations exceed bacterial populations in these environments suggesting that  a relationship may exist between viruses and bacteria.

1626613	"Mutational analysis of the rotavirus NSP4 enterotoxic domain that binds to caveolin-1,""Background: Rotavirus (RV) nonstructural protein 4 (NSP4) is the first described viral enterotoxin, which induces early secretory diarrhea in neonatal rodents. Our previous data show a direct interaction between RV NSP4 and the structural protein of caveolae, caveolin-1 (cav-1), in yeast and mammalian cells. The binding site of cav-1 mapped to the NSP4 amphipathic helix, and led us to examine which helical face was responsible for the interaction. Methods: A panel of NSP4 mutants were prepared and tested for binding to cav-1 by yeast two hybrid and direct binding assays. The charged residues of the NSP4 amphipathic helix were changed to alanine (NSP4<sub>46-175</sub>-ala6); and three residues in the hydrophobic face were altered to charged amino acids (NSP4<sub>46-175</sub>-HydroMut). In total, twelve mutants of NSP4 were generated to define the cav-1 binding site. Synthetic peptides corresponding to the hydrophobic and charged faces of NSP4 were examined for structural changes by circular dichroism (P06721) and diarrhea induction by a neonatal mouse study. Results: Mutations of the hydrophilic face (NSP4<sub>46-175</sub>-Ala6) bound cav-1 akin to wild type NSP4. In contrast, disruption of the hydrophobic face (NSP<sub>446-175</sub>-HydroMut) failed to bind cav-1. These data suggest NSP4 and cav-1 associate via a hydrophobic interaction. Analyses of mutant synthetic peptides in which the hydrophobic residues in the enterotoxic domain of NSP4 were altered suggested a critical hydrophobic residue. Both NSP4<sub>HydroMut112-140</sub>, that contains three charged amino acids (aa113, 124, 131) changed from the original hydrophobic residues and NSP4<sub>AlaAcidic112-140</sub> that contained three alanine residues substituted for negatively charged (aa114, 125, 132) amino acids failed to induce diarrhea. Whereas peptides NSP4wild type <sub>112 -140</sub> and NSP4<sub>AlaBasic112-140</sub> that contained three alanine substituted for positively charged (aa115, 119, 133) amino acids, induced diarrhea. Conclusions: These data show that the cav-1 binding domain is within the hydrophobic face of the NSP4 amphipathic helix. The integrity of the helical structure is important for both cav-1 binding and diarrhea induction implying a connection between NSP4 functional and binding activities."""

We have characterized a previously unknown organic hydroperoxide resistance regulator from Burkholderia xenovoransLB400, Bxe_B2842, which is homologous to E. coli’s OhrR. Bxe_B2842 regulates the expression of an organic hydroperoxide resistance protein (OsmC). We utilized frontal affinity chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (FAC-P13009) and electrophoretic mobility gel shift assays (EMSA) to identify and characterize the possible effectors of the regulation by Bxe_B2842. Without an effector, Bxe_B2842 binds a DNA operator sequence (DOS) upstream of osmC. FAC-P13009 results suggest that 2-aminophenol binds to the protein and is potentially an effector molecule. EMSA analysis shows that 2-aminophenol also attenuates the Bxe_B2842’s affinity for its DOS. EMSA analysis also shows that organic peroxides attenuate Bxe_B2842/DOS affinity, suggesting that binding of the TR to its DOS is regulated by the two-cysteine mechanism, common to TRs in this family. Bxe_B2842 is the first OhrR TR to have both oxidative and effector-binding mechanisms of regulation.

The expenditure of this energy is one of the central issues of cellular metabolism. Chloroplasts contain ~3,000 proteins, among which less than 100 are typically encoded in the plastid genome. The rest are encoded in the nuclear genome, synthesized in the cytosol, and posttranslationally imported into the organelle in an energy-dependent process. We report here a measurement of the amount of P22259 hydrolyzed to import a protein across the chloroplast envelope membranes--only the second complete accounting of the cost in Gibbs free energy of protein transport to be undertaken. Using two different precursors prepared by three distinct techniques, we show that the import of a precursor protein into chloroplasts is accompanied by the hydrolysis of ~650 P22259 molecules. This translates to a ΔG<sub>protein transport</sub> of some 27,300 kJ/mol protein imported.

1904753	"Improving Lambda Red Genome Engineering in <em>Escherichia coli</em> via Rational Removal of Endogenous Nucleases,""Lambda Red recombineering is a powerful technique for making targeted genetic changes in bacteria. However, many applications are limited by the frequency of recombination. Previous studies have suggested that endogenous nucleases may hinder recombination by degrading the exogenous DNA used for recombineering. In this work, we identify ExoVII as a nuclease which degrades the ends of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) oligonucleotides and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) cassettes. Removing this nuclease improves both recombination frequency and the inheritance of mutations at the 3' ends of ssDNA and dsDNA. Extending this approach, we show that removing a set of five exonucleases (RecJ, P04995, ExoVII, ExoX, and Lambda Exo) substantially improves the performance of co-selection multiplex automatable genome engineering (CoS-MAGE). In a given round of CoS-MAGE with ten ssDNA oligonucleotides, the five nuclease knockout strain has on average 46% more alleles converted per clone, 200% more clones with five or more allele conversions, and 35% fewer clones without any allele conversions. Finally, we use these nuclease knockout strains to investigate and clarify the effects of oligonucleotide phosphorothioation on recombination frequency.

1626546	"The crystal structures of the tri-functional Chloroflexus aurantiacus and bi-functional Rhodobacter sphaeroides malyl-CoA lyases and comparison with CitE-like superfamily enzymes and malate synthases,""Background: Malyl-CoA lyase (MCL) is a promiscuous carbon-carbon bond lyase that catalyzes the reversible cleavage of structurally related Coenzyme A (CoA) thioesters. This enzyme plays a crucial, multifunctional role in the 3- hydroxypropionate bi-cycle for autotrophic CO2 fixation in Chloroflexus aurantiacus. A second, phylogenetically distinct MCL from Rhodobacter sphaeroides is involved in the ethylmalonyl-CoA pathway for acetate assimilation. Both MCLs belong to the large superfamily of CitE-like enzymes, which includes the name-giving β-subunit of citrate lyase (CitE), malyl-CoA thioesterases and other enzymes of unknown physiological function. The CitE-like enzyme superfamily also bears sequence and structural resemblance to the malate synthases. All of these different enzymes share highly conserved catalytic residues, although they catalyze distinctly different reactions: C-C bond formation and cleavage, thioester hydrolysis, or both (the malate synthases). Results: Here we report the first crystal structures of MCLs from two different phylogenetic subgroups in apo- and substrate-bound forms. Both the C. aurantiacus and the R. sphaeroides MCL contain elaborations on the canonical β8/α8 P0A858 barrel fold and form hexameric assemblies. Upon ligand binding, changes in the C-terminal domains of the MCLs result in closing of the active site, with the C-terminal domain of one monomer forming a lid over and contributing side chains to the active site of the adjacent monomer. The distinctive features of the two MCL subgroups were compared to known structures of other CitE-like superfamily enzymes and to malate synthases, providing insight into the structural subtleties that underlie the functional versatility of these enzymes. Conclusions: Although the C. aurantiacus and the R. sphaeroides MCLs have divergent primary structures (~37% identical), their tertiary and quaternary structures are very similar. It can be assumed that the C-C bond formation catalyzed by the MCLs occurs as proposed for malate synthases. However, a comparison of the two MCL structures with known malate synthases raised the question why the MCLs are not also able to hydrolyze CoA thioester bonds. Our results suggest the previously proposed reaction mechanism for malate synthases may be incomplete or not entirely correct.

1623808	"Nucleotide degradation and ribose salvage in yeast,""Nucleotide degradation is a universal metabolic capability. Here we combine metabolomics, genetics and biochemistry to characterize the yeast pathway. Nutrient starvation, via PKA, AMPK/SNF1, and TOR, triggers autophagic breakdown of ribosomes into nucleotides. A protein not previously associated with nucleotide degradation, Phm8, converts nucleotide monophosphates into nucleosides. Downstream steps, which involve the purine nucleoside phosphorylase, Pnp1, and pyrimidine nucleoside hydrolase, Urh1, funnel ribose into the nonoxidative pentose phosphate pathway. During carbon starvation, the ribose-derived carbon accumulates as sedoheptulose-7- phosphate, whose consumption by transaldolase is impaired due to depletion of transaldolase’s other substrate, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. Oxidative stress increases glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, resulting in rapid consumption of sedoheptulose-7-phosphate to make P80644 for antioxidant defense. Ablation of Phm8 or double deletion of Pnp1 and Urh1 prevent effective nucleotide salvage, resulting in metabolite depletion and impaired survival of starving yeast. Thus, ribose salvage provides means of surviving nutrient starvation and oxidative stress."""	Molecular Systems Biology	"('P80644', 'NADPH')"

Levels of the second messenger cyclic dimeric P24174 (c-di-P24174) are regulated by a variety of environmental stimuli and play a critical role in regulating cellular processes such as biofilm formation and cellular motility. Cyclic di-P24174 signaling systems have been largely characterized in pathogenic bacteria; however, proteins that can impact the synthesis or degradation of c-di-P24174 are prominent in cyanobacterial species and yet remain largely underexplored. In cyanobacteria, many putative c-di-P24174 synthesis or degradation domains are found in genes that also harbor light-responsive signal input domains, suggesting that light is an important signal for altering c-di-P24174 homeostasis. Indeed, c-di-P24174-associated domains are often the second most common output domain in photoreceptors—outnumbered only by a histidine kinase output domain. Cyanobacteria differ from other bacteria regarding the number and types of photoreceptor domains associated with c-di-P24174 domains. Due to the widespread distribution of c-di-P24174 domains in cyanobacteria, we investigated the evolutionary origin of a subset of genes. Phylogenetic analyses showed that c-di-P24174 signaling systems were present early in cyanobacteria and c-di-P24174 genes were both vertically and horizontally inherited during their evolution.

A major challenge of systems biology is to describe biological systems as a computational model, which can be used to derive novel hypothesis and drive experiments leading to new knowledge. The constraint-based reconstruction and analysis approach has been successfully applied to metabolism and to the macromolecular synthesis machinery assembly. Here, we present the first integrated stoichiometric multiscale model of metabolism and macromolecular synthesis for Escherichia coli K12 MG1655, which describes the sequence-specific synthesis and function of almost 2000 gene products at molecular detail. We added linear constraints, which couple enzyme synthesis and catalysis reactions. Comparison with experimental data showed improvement of growth phenotype prediction with the multiscale model over E. coli’s metabolic model alone. Many of the genes covered by this integrated model are well conserved across enterobacters and other, less related bacteria. We addressed the question of whether the bias in synonymous codon usage could affect the growth phenotype and environmental niches that an organism can occupy. We created two classes of in silico strains, one with more biased codon usage and one with more equilibrated codon usage than the wildtype. The reduced growth phenotype in biased strains was caused by P0A873 supply shortage, indicating that expansion of P0A873 gene content or P0A873 codon recognition allow E. coli to respond to changes in codon usage bias. Our analysis suggests that in order to maximize growth and to adapt to new environmental niches, codon usage and P0A873 content must co-evolve. These results provide further evidence for the mutation-selection-drift balance theory of codon usage bias.

Principal components analysis (PCA) was applied to the P13009 data to differentiate species in Escherichia coli-Saccharomyces cerevisiae coculture biofilms. PCA of LDPI-P13009 also differentiated individual E. coli strains in a biofilm comprised of two interacting gene deletion strains, even though these strains differed from the wild type K-12 strain by no more than four gene deletions each out of approximately 2000 genes. PCA treatment of 7.87 eV LDPI-P13009 data separated the E. coli strains into three distinct groups two ?pure? groups and a mixed region. Furthermore, the ?pure? regions of the E. coli cocultures showed greater variance by PCA when analyzed by 7.87 eV photon energies than by 10.5 eV radiation. Comparison of the 7.87 and 10.5 eV data is consistent with the expectation that the lower photon energy selects a subset of low ionization energy analytes while 10.5 eV is more inclusive, detecting a wider range of analytes.

1164083	"Structure, function and regulation of the enzymes in the starch biosynthetic pathway.,""Starch is the major reserve polysaccharide in nature and accounts for the majority of the caloric intact of humans. It is also gaining importance as a renewable and biodegradable industrial material. There is burgeoning interest in increasing the amount and altering the properties of the plant starches by plant genetic modification. A rational approach to this effort will require a detailed, atomic-level understanding of the enzymatic processes that produce the starch granule. The starch granule is a complex particle made up of alternating layers of crystalline and amorphous lamellae. It consists of two types of polymer, amylose, a polymer of relatively long chains of α-1,4-linked glucans that contain virtually no branches, and amylopectin, which is highly branched and contains much shorter chains. This complex structure is synthesized by the coordinate activities of the starch synthases (SS), which elongate the polysaccharide chain by addition of glucose units via α-1,4 linkages using ADP- glucose as a donor, and branching enzymes (P07762), which branch the polysaccharide chain by cleavage of α₋1,4 linkages and subsequent re-attachment via α₋1,6 linkages. Several isoforms of both starch synthase (SS) and branching enzyme (P07762) are found in plants, including SSI, SSII, SSIII and granule- bound SS (GBSS), and SBEI, SBEIIa and SBEIIb. These isoforms have different activities and substrate and product specificities and play different roles in creating the granule and determining the properties of the resulting starch. The overarching goal of this proposal is to begin to understand the regulation and specificities of these enzymes at the atomic level. High-resolution X-ray structures of these enzymes bound to substrates and products will be determined to visualize the molecular interactions responsible for the properties of the enzymes. Hypotheses regarding these issues will then be tested using mutagenesis and enzyme assays.

In addition our structure of a glycogen branching enzyme bound to malto-oligosaccharides identified seven distinct binding sites distributed about the surface of the enzyme. We will now determine the function of these sites to get a molecular-level picture of exactly how these enzymes interact with their polymeric substrates and confer specificity leading to the complex structure of the starch granule.

While bulk kinetic measurements rely on discrete state-like approximations to the energy landscape, single-molecule methods can project the free energy onto specific coordinates. With measures of the diffusion, one may establish a quantitative bridge between state-like kinetic measurements and the continuous energy landscape. We used an all-atom molecular dynamics simulation of the 70S ribosome (2.1 million atoms; 1.3 microseconds) to provide this bridge for specific conformational events associated with the process of P0A873 translocation. Starting from a pre-translocation configuration, we identified sets of residues that collectively undergo rotary rearrangements implicated in ribosome function. Estimates of the diffusion coefficients along these collective coordinates for translocation were then used to interconvert between experimental rates and measures of the energy landscape. This analysis, in conjunction with previously reported experimental rates of translocation, provides an upper-bound estimate of the free-energy barriers associated with translocation.

Infected infants have high mortality rates, and survivors often suffer life-long neurological disorders. The causes of many NICU infections go undiagnosed, and there is debate as to the importance of inanimate hospital environments (IHEs) in the spread of infections. Here, we used culture-independent next-generation sequencing to survey bacterial diversity in two San Diego NICUs and to track the sources of microbes in these environments. Thirty IHE samples were collected from two Level-Three NICU facilities. We extracted DNA from these samples and amplified the bacterial small subunit (16S) ribosomal RNA gene sequence using ‘universal’ barcoded primers. The purified PCR products were pooled into a single reaction for pyrosequencing, and the data were analyzed using QIIME. On average, we detected 93+/-39 (mean +/- standard deviation) bacterial genera per sample in NICU IHEs. Many of the bacterial genera included known opportunistic pathogens, and many were skin-associated (e.g., Propionibacterium).

The kinase domain is oftentimes flanked by additional ligand binding domains that up- or down-regulate catalytic function. C-terminal Src kinase (Csk) is a multidomain tyrosine kinase that is up-regulated by N-terminal SH2 and SH3 domains. Although the X-ray structure of Csk suggests the enzyme is compact, X-ray scattering studies indicate that the enzyme possesses both compact and open conformational forms in solution.

We find that binding of AMP-P0ABP8 shifts the ensemble towards more extended rather than more compact conformations. Binding of ADP further shifts the ensemble towards extended conformations, including highly extended conformations not adopted by the apo protein, nor by the AMP-P0ABP8 bound protein. These ensembles indicate that any compaction of the kinase domain induced by nucleotide binding does not extend to the overall multi-domain architecture. Instead, assembly of an P22259-bound kinase domain generates further extended forms of Csk that may have relevance for kinase scaffolding and Src regulation in the cell."""

1904579	"Dual Function of Novel Pollen Coat (Surface) Proteins: IgE-binding Capacity and Proteolytic Activity Disrupting the Airway Epithelial Barrier,""The pollen coat is the first structure of the pollen to encounter the mucosal immune system upon inhalation. Prior characterizations of pollen allergens have focused on water-soluble, cytoplasmic proteins, but have overlooked much of the extracellular pollen coat. Due to washing with organic solvents when prepared, these pollen coat proteins are typically absent from commercial standardized allergenic extracts (i.e., ‘‘de-fatted’’), and, as a result, their involvement in allergy has not been explored. Using a unique approach to search for pollen allergenic proteins residing in the pollen coat, we employed transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to assess the impact of organic solvents on the structural integrity of the pollen coat. TEM results indicated that de-fatting of Cynodon dactylon (Bermuda grass) pollen (BGP) by use of organic solvents altered the structural integrity of the pollen coat. The novel IgE-binding proteins of the BGP coat include a cysteine protease (P13029) and endoxylanase (EXY). The full-length cDNA that encodes the novel IgE-reactive P13029 was cloned from floral RNA. The EXY and P13029 were purified to homogeneity and tested for IgE reactivity. The P13029 from the BGP coat increased the permeability of human airway epithelial cells, caused a clear concentration-dependent detachment of cells, and damaged their barrier integrity. Using an immunoproteomics approach, novel allergenic proteins of the BGP coat were identified. These proteins represent a class of novel dual-function proteins residing on the coat of the pollen grain that have IgE-binding capacity and proteolytic activity, which disrupts the integrity of the airway epithelial barrier. The identification of pollen coat allergens might explain the IgE-negative response to available skin-prick-testing proteins in patients who have positive symptoms. Further study of the role of these pollen coat proteins in allergic responses is warranted and could potentially lead to the development of improved diagnostic and therapeutic tools."""

Their unique morphology and mode of propulsion also represent major pathogenicity factors of clinical spirochetes. Here we describe the genome sequences of two coccoid isolates of the recently described genus Sphaerochaeta which are members of the phylum Spirochaetes based on A8C927 gene and whole-genome phylogenies. Interestingly, the Sphaerochaeta genomes completely lack the motility and associated signal transduction genes present in all sequenced spirochete genomes. Additional analyses revealed that the lack of flagella is associated with a unique, nonrigid cell wall structure hallmarked by a lack of transpeptidase and transglycosylase genes, which is also unprecedented in spirochetes. The Sphaerochaeta genomes are highly enriched in fermentation and carbohydrate metabolism genes relative to other spirochetes, indicating a fermentative lifestyle. Remarkably, most of the enriched genes appear to have been acquired from nonspirochetes, particularly clostridia, in several massive horizontal gene transfer events (>40% of the total number of genes in each genome).

1053428	"Integration of Carbon, Nitrogen, and Oxygen Metabolism in Escherichia coli--Final Report,""A key challenge for living systems is balancing utilization of multiple elemental nutrients, such as carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, whose availability is subject to environmental fluctuations. As growth can be limited by the scarcity of any one nutrient, the rate at which each nutrient is assimilated must be sensitive not only to its own availability, but also to that of other nutrients. Remarkably, across diverse nutrient conditions, E. coli grows nearly optimally, balancing effectively the conversion of carbon into energy versus biomass. To investigate the link between the metabolism of different nutrients, we quantified metabolic responses to nutrient perturbations using LC-P13009 based metabolomics and built differential equation models that bridge multiple nutrient systems. We discovered that the carbonaceous substrate of nitrogen assimilation, -ketoglutarate, directly inhibits glucose uptake and that the upstream glycolytic metabolite, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, ultrasensitively regulates anaplerosis to allow rapid adaptation to changing carbon availability. We also showed that NADH controls the metabolic response to changing oxygen levels. Our findings support a general mechanism for nutrient integration: limitation for a nutrient other than carbon leads to build-up of the most closely related product of carbon metabolism, which in turn feedback inhibits further carbon uptake."""

Most studies have had limited ability to deeply sample community structure (e.g. Sanger-sequenced A8C927 libraries), or have had limited taxonomic resolution (e.g. studies based on A8C927 hypervariable region sequencing). Here, we combine the higher taxonomic resolution of near-full-length A8C927 gene amplicons with the economics and sensitivity of short-read sequencing to assay the abundance and identity of organisms that represent as little as 0.01% of sediment bacterial communities. We used a new version of EMIRGE optimized for large data size to reconstruct near-full-length A8C927 genes from amplicons sheared and sequenced with Illumina technology. The approach allowed us to differentiate the community composition among samples acquired before perturbation, after acetate amendment shifted the predominant metabolism to iron reduction, and once sulfate reduction began. Results were highly reproducible across technical replicates, and identified specific taxa that responded to the perturbation. All samples contain very high alpha diversity and abundant organisms from phyla without cultivated representatives.

We analyzed metagenome sequence obtained from six thermal “filamentous streamer” communities (~40 Mbp per site), which targeted three different groups of Aquificales found in Yellowstone National Park (YNP). Unassembled metagenome sequence and PCR-amplified A8C927 gene libraries revealed that acidic, sulfidic sites were dominated by Hydrogenobaculum (Aquificaceae) populations, whereas the circum-neutral pH (6.5–7.8) sites containing dissolved sulfide were dominated by Sulfurihydrogenibium spp. (Hydrogenothermaceae). Thermocrinis (Aquificaceae) populations were found primarily in the circum-neutral sites with undetectable sulfide, and to a lesser extent in one sulfidic system at pH 8. Phylogenetic analysis of assembled sequence containing A8C927 genes as well as conserved protein-encoding genes revealed that the composition and function of these communities varied across geochemical conditions. Each Aquificales lineage contained genes for CO2 fixation by the reverse-TCA cycle, but only the Sulfurihydrogenibium populations perform citrate cleavage using P22259 citrate lyase (Acl). The Aquificaceae populations use an alternative pathway catalyzed by two separate enzymes, citryl-CoA synthetase (Ccs), and citryl-CoA lyase (Ccl). All three Aquificales lineages contained evidence of aerobic respiration, albeit due to completely different types of heme Cu oxidases (subunit I) involved in oxygen reduction. The distribution of Aquificales populations and differences among functional genes involved in energy generation and electron transport is consistent with the hypothesis that geochemical parameters (e.g., pH, sulfide, H2, O2) have resulted in niche specialization among members of the Aquificales."""

AdoP interacts directly with the preferred substrate through a hydrogen-bond donation from the catalytically important residue Asp204 to N7 of the purine base. Comparison with Escherichia coli P0ABP8 revealed a more optimal orientation of Asp204 towards N7 of adenosine and a more closed active site. When inosine is bound, two water molecules are interposed between Asp204 and the N7 and O6 atoms of the nucleoside, thus allowing the enzyme to find alternative but less efficient ways to stabilize the transition state.

ArcA, homologue of a global regulator controlling hundreds of genes involved in aerobic and anaerobic respiration in E. coli, was shown to be important in aerobiosis/anaerobiosis of S. oneidensis as well.

Trm1 and Trm11 enzymes are known to be responsible for several of the D/anticodon arm modifications, but methylases catalyzing post-transcriptional m<sup>2</sup> G synthesis in the acceptor stem are uncharacterized. Here, we report that the MJ0438 gene from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii encodes a novel S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferase, now identified as Trm14, which generates m<sup>2</sup> G at position 6 in P0A873<sup>Cys</sup>. The 381 amino acid Trm14 protein possesses a canonical RNA recognition THUMP domain at the amino terminus, followed by a γ-class Rossmann fold amino-methyltransferase catalytic domain featuring the signature NPPY active site motif. Trm14 is associated with cluster of orthologous groups (COG) 0116, and most closely resembles the m<sup>2</sup> G10 P0A873 methylase Trm11. Phylogenetic analysis reveals a canonical archaeal/ bacterial evolutionary separation with 20–30% sequence identities between the two branches, but it is likely that the detailed functions of COG 0116 enzymes differ between the archaeal and bacterial domains. In the archaeal branch, the protein is found exclusively in thermophiles. More distantly related Trm14 homologs were also identified in eukaryotes known to possess the m<sup>2</sup> G6 P0A873 modification."""	Nucleic Acids Research	"('P0A873', 'tRNA')"

Iron acquisition in the case of pathogenic bacteria has long been established as an important virulence mechanism. Here, we report a 3.0 Å crystal structure of a ferritin, annotated as P0ABD3 B (BfrB), from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis that continues to be one of the world’s deadliest diseases. Similar to the other members of ferritin family, the Mtb BfrB subunit exhibits the characteristic fold of a four-helical bundle that possesses the ferroxidase catalytic centre. We compare the structure of Mtb BfrB with representatives of the ferritin family belonging to the archaea, eubacteria and eukarya. Unlike most other ferritins, Mtb BfrB has an extended C-terminus. To dissect the role of this extended C-terminus, truncated Mtb BfrB was purified and biochemical studies implicate this region in ferroxidase activity and iron release in addition to providing stability to the protein. Functionally important regions in a protein of known 3D-structure can be determined by estimating the degree of conservation of the amino-acid sites with its close homologues. Based on the comparative studies, we identify the slowly evolving conserved sites as well as the rapidly evolving variable sites and analyze their role in relation to structure and function of Mtb BfrB. Further, electrostatic computations demonstrate that although the electrostatic environment of catalytic residues is preserved within the family, extensive variability is exhibited by residues defining the channels and pores, in all likelihood keeping up with the diverse functions executed by these ferritins in varied environments."""

1623799	"Economics of membrane occupancy and respiro-fermentation,""The simultaneous utilization of efficient respiration and inefficient fermentation even in the presence of abundant oxygen is a puzzling phenomenon commonly observed in bacteria, yeasts, and cancer cells. Despite extensive research, the biochemical basis for this phenomenon remains obscure. We hypothesize that the outcome of a competition for membrane space between glucose transporters and respiratory chain (which we refer to as economics of membrane occupancy) proteins influences respiration and fermentation. By incorporating a sole constraint based on this concept in the genome-scale metabolic model of Escherichia coli, we were able to simulate respirofermentation. Further analysis of the impact of this constraint revealed differential utilization of the cytochromes and faster glucose uptake under anaerobic conditions than under aerobic conditions. Based on these simulations, we propose that bacterial cells manage the composition of their cytoplasmic membrane to maintain optimal P22259 production by switching between oxidative and substrate-level phosphorylation. These results suggest that the membrane occupancy constraint may be a fundamental governing constraint of cellular metabolism and physiology, and establishes a direct link between cell morphology and physiology."""

Bioinformatic techniques were used to assemble two nearly complete genomes from marine metagenomes and single-cell sequencing provided two more partial genomes. Recruitment of metagenomic data shows that these SAR86 genomes substantially increase our knowledge of non-photosynthetic bacteria in the surface ocean. Phylogenomic analyses establish SAR86 as a basal and divergent lineage of c-proteobacteria, and the individual genomes display a temperature dependent distribution. Modestly sized at 1.25–1.7 Mbp, the SAR86 genomes lack several pathways for amino-acid and vitamin synthesis as well as sulfate reduction, trends commonly observed in other abundant marine microbes. SAR86 appears to be an aerobic chemoheterotroph with the potential for proteorhodopsin-based P22259 generation, though the apparent lack of a retinal biosynthesis pathway may require it to scavenge exogenously-derived pigments to utilize proteorhodopsin. The genomes contain an expanded capacity for the degradation of lipids and carbohydrates acquired using a wealth of tonB-dependent outer membrane receptors.

UvrD couples P22259 binding and hydrolysis to unwind double-stranded DNA and translocate along ssDNA with 3'-to-5' directionality. Although a UvrD monomer is able to translocate along ssDNA rapidly and processively, DNA helicase activity in vitro requires a minimum of a UvrD dimer. Previous crystal structures of UvrD bound to a ssDNA/duplex DNA junction show that its 2B sub-domain exists in a 'closed' state and interacts with the duplex DNA. Here, we report a crystal structure of an apo form of UvrD in which the 2B sub-domain is in an 'open' state that differs by an {approx} 160{sup o} rotation of the 2B sub-domain. To study the rotational conformational states of the 2B sub-domain in various ligation states, we constructed a series of double-cysteine UvrD mutants and labeled them with fluorophores such that rotation of the 2B sub-domain results in changes in fluorescence resonance energy transfer. These studies show that the open and closed forms can interconvert in solution, with low salt favoring the closed conformation and high salt favoring the open conformation in the absence of DNA. Binding of UvrD to DNA and P22259 binding and hydrolysis also affect the rotational conformational state of the 2B sub-domain, suggesting that 2B sub-domain rotation is coupled to the function of this nucleic acid motor enzyme."""

In Archaea, three types of splicing endonuclease [homotetrameric: α<sub>4</sub>, homodimeric: α<sub>2</sub>, and heterotetrameric: (αβ)<sub>2</sub>] have been identified, each representing different substrate specificity during the P0A873 intron cleavage. Here, we discovered a fourth type of archaeal P0A873 splicing endonuclease (ε<sub>2</sub>) in the genome of the acidophilic archaeon Candidatus Micrarchaeum acidiphilum, referred to as ARMAN-2 and its closely related species, ARMAN-1. The enzyme consists of two duplicated catalytic units and one structural unit encoded on a single gene, representing a novel three-unit architecture.

Instead, catalysis is dependent on residues that coordinate the magnesium ions and residues that position the substrate properly for catalysis.

A cDNA library was constructed from T. infestans anterior midgut, and 244 clones were sequenced. Among the EST sequences, an open reading frame (ORF) with homology to a cystatin type 2 precursor was identified. Then, a 288-bp cDNA fragment encoding mature cystatin (lacking signal peptide) named Tigutcystatin was cloned fused to a N-terminal His tag in pET-14b vector, and the protein expressed in Escherichia coli strain Rosetta gami. Tigutcystatin purified and cleaved by thrombin to remove His tag presented molecular mass of 11 kDa and 10,137 Da by SDS-PAGE and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, respectively. Purified Tigutcystatin was shown to be a tight inhibitor towards cruzain, a T. cruzi cathepsin L-like enzyme (K{sub i} = 3.29 nM) and human cathepsin L (K{sub i} = 3.78 nM). Tissue specific expression analysis showed that Tigutcystatin was mostly expressed in anterior midgut, although amplification in small intestine was also detected by semi quantitative P0DV86-PCR. qReal time PCR confirmed that Tigutcystatin mRNA is significantly up-regulated in anterior midgut when T. infestans is infected with T. cruzi.

It belongs to the kanamycin– apramycin methyltransferase (Kam) family and specifically methylates the A8C927 at the N1 position of A1408. We determined the structures of apo-NpmA and its complexes with S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) and S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) at 2.4, 2.7 and 1.68 Å, respectively. We generated a number of NpmA variants with alanine substitutions and studied their ability to bind the cofactor, to methylate A1408 in the 30S subunit, and to confer resistance to kanamycin in vivo. Residues D30, W107 and W197 were found to be essential. We have also analyzed the interactions between NpmA and the 30S subunit by footprinting experiments and computational docking. Helices 24, 42 and 44 were found to be the main NpmA-binding site. Both experimental and theoretical analyses suggest that NpmA flips out the target nucleotide A1408 to carry out the methylation. NpmA is plasmid-encoded and can be transferred between pathogenic bacteria; therefore it poses a threat to the successful use of aminoglycosides in clinical practice.

Human UPP activity has been a focus of cancer research due to its role in activating fluoropyrimidine nucleoside chemotherapeutic agents such as 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and capecitabine. Additionally, specific molecular inhibitors of this enzyme have been found to raise endogenous uridine concentrations, which can produce a cytoprotective effect on normal tissues exposed to these drugs. Here we report the structure of hUPP1 bound to 5-FU at 2.3 Å resolution. Analysis of this structure reveals new insights as to the conformational motions the enzyme undergoes in the course of substrate binding and catalysis. The dimeric enzyme is capable of a large hinge motion between its two domains, facilitating ligand exchange and explaining observed cooperativity between the two active sites in binding phosphate-bearing substrates. Further, a loop toward the back end of the uracil binding pocket is shown to flexibly adjust to the varying chemistry of different compounds through an ‘‘induced-fit’’ association mechanism that was not observed in earlier hUPP1 structures. The details surrounding these dynamic aspects of hUPP1 structure and function provide unexplored avenues to develop novel inhibitors of this protein with improved specificity and increased affinity. Given the recent emergence of new roles for uridine as a neuron protective compound in ischemia and degenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s, inhibitors of hUPP1 with greater efficacy, which are able to boost cellular uridine levels without adverse side-effects, may have a wide range of therapeutic applications."""

Unfortunately, reliably predicting that a protein will contain a specific metal from its amino acid sequence is not currently possible. We recently developed a generally-applicable experimental technique for finding metalloproteins on a genome-wide scale. Applying this metal-directed protein purification approach (ICP-P13009 and P13009/P13009 based) to the prototypical microbe Pyrococcus furiosus conclusively demonstrated the extent and diversity of the uncharacterized portion of microbial metalloproteomes since a majority of the observed metal peaks could not be assigned to known or predicted metalloproteins. However, even using this technique, it is not technically feasible to purify to homogeneity all metalloproteins in an organism. In order to address these limitations and complement the metal-directed protein purification, we developed a computational infrastructure and statistical methodology to aid in the pursuit and identification of novel metalloproteins. We demonstrate that our methodology enables predictions of metal-protein interactions using an experimental data set derived from a chromatography fractionation experiment in which 870 proteins and 10 metals were measured over 2,589 fractions. For each of the 10 metals, cobalt, iron, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, lead, tungsten, uranium, vanadium, and zinc, clusters of proteins frequently occurring in metal peaks (of a specific metal) within the fractionation space were defined. This resulted in predictions that there are from 5 undiscovered vanadium- to 13 undiscovered cobalt-containing proteins in Pyrococcus furiosus. Molybdenum and nickel were chosen for additional assessment producing lists of genes predicted to encode metalloproteins or metalloprotein subunits, 22 for nickel including seven from known nickel-proteins, and 20 for molybdenum including two from known molybdo-proteins. The uncharacterized proteins are prime candidates for metal-based purification or recombinant approaches to validate these predictions. We conclude that the largely uncharacterized extent of native metalloproteomes can be revealed through analysis of the co-occurrence of metals and proteins across a fractionation space.

JASMONATE ZIM-DOMAIN (JAZ) proteins inhibit transcription factors that regulate early JA-responsive genes, and JA-induced degradation of JAZ proteins thus allows expression of these response genes. To date, MYC2 is the only transcription factor known to interact directly with JAZ proteins and regulate early JA responses, but the phenotype of myc2 mutants suggests that other transcription factors also activate JA responses. To identify JAZ1-interacting proteins, a yeast two-hybrid screen of an Arabidopsis cDNA library was performed. Two basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins, MYC3 and MYC4, were identified. MYC3 and MYC4 share high sequence similarity with MYC2, suggesting they may have similar biological functions. MYC3 and MYC4 interact not only with JAZ1 but also with other JAZ proteins (JAZ3 and JAZ9) in both yeast two-hybrid and pull-down assays. MYC2, MYC3, and MYC4 were all capable of inducing expression of JAZ::P05804 reporter constructs following transfection of carrot protoplasts. Although myc3 and myc4 loss-of-function mutants showed no phenotype, transgenic plants overexpressing MYC3 and MYC4 had higher levels of anthocyanin compared to the wild-type plants. In addition, roots of MYC3 overexpression plants were hypersensitive to JA. Quantitative real-time P0DV86-PCR expression analysis of nine JAresponsive genes revealed that eight of them were induced in MYC3 and MYC4 overexpression plants, except for a pathogen-responsive gene, PDF1.2.

Human small airway epithelial, umbilical vein endothelial, Caco-2, and Hep-G2 cells were found to be susceptible. Sups displayed a reduction of pH to 5.3–5.5, indicating the onset of acid anaerobic fermentation; however, low pH itself was not a major factor of toxicity. The pore-forming hemolysin, anthrolysin O (ALO), contributed to the toxicity in a concentrationdependent manner. Its effect was found to be synergistic with a metabolic product of B. anthracis, succinic acid. Cells exposed to Sups demonstrated cytoplasmic membrane blebbing, increased permeability, loss of P22259, mitochondrial membrane potential collapse, and arrest of cell respiration. The toxicity was reduced by inhibition of ALO by cholesterol, decomposition of reactive oxygen species, and inhibition of mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase. Cell death appears to be caused by an acute primary membrane permeabilization by ALO, followed by a burst of reactive radicals from the mitochondria fuelled by the succinate, which is generated by bacteria in the hypoxic environment.

1082970	"Imaging gene expression in real-time using aptamers,""Signal transduction pathways are usually activated by external stimuli and are transient. The downstream changes such as transcription of the activated genes are also transient. Real-time detection of promoter activity is useful for understanding changes in gene expression, especially during cell differentiation and in development. A simple and reliable method for viewing gene expression in real time is not yet available. Reporter proteins such as fluorescent proteins and luciferase allow for non-invasive detection of the products of gene expression in living cells. However, current reporter systems do not provide for real-time imaging of promoter activity in living cells. This is because of the long time period after transcription required for fluorescent protein synthesis and maturation. We have developed an RNA reporter system for imaging in real-time to detect changes in promoter activity as they occur. The RNA reporter uses strings of RNA aptamers that constitute IMAGEtags (Intracellular MultiAptamer GEnetic tags), which can be expressed from a promoter of choice. The tobramycin, neomycin and PDC RNA aptamers have been utilized for this system and expressed in yeast from the GAL1 promoter. The IMAGEtag RNA kinetics were quantified by P0DV86-qPCR. In yeast precultured in raffinose containing media the GAL1 promoter responded faster than in yeast precultured in glucose containing media. IMAGEtag RNA has relatively short half-life (5.5 min) in yeast. For imaging, the yeast cells are incubated with their ligands that are labeled with fluorescent dyes. To increase signal to noise, ligands have been separately conjugated with the FRET (Förster resonance energy transfer) pairs, Cy3 and Cy5. With these constructs, the transcribed aptamers can be imaged after activation of the promoter by galactose. FRET was confirmed with three different approaches, which were sensitized emission, acceptor photobleaching and donor lifetime by FLIM (fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy). Real-time transcription was measured by FLIM-FRET, which was detected by the decrease in donor lifetime resulting from ligand binding to IMAGEtags that were newly synthesized from the activated GAL1 promoter.

We present here a robust, metal-based approach to determine all metals an organism assimilates and identify its metalloproteins on a genome-wide scale. This shifts the focus from classical protein-based purification to metal-based identification and purification by liquid chromatography, high-throughput tandem mass spectrometry (HT-P13009/P13009) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-P13009) to characterize cytoplasmic metalloproteins from an exemplary microorganism (Pyrococcus furiosus).

We analyzed the transcriptome of EKC/KEOPS mutants and observed a specific profile that is highly enriched in targets of the Gcn4p transcriptional activator. GCN4 expression was found to be activated at the translational level in mutants via the defective recognition of the inhibitory upstream ORFs (uORFs) present in its leader.

1346734	"Anaerobic Co-digestion for Enhanced Renewable Energy and Green House Gas Emission Reduction,""The need to develop renewable energy is important for replacing fossil fuel, which is limited in quantity and also tends to increase in price over time. The addition of high strength organic wastes in municipal anaerobic digesters is growing and tends to increase renewable energy production. In addition, conversion of wastes to energy significantly reduces uncontrolled greenhouse gas emissions. Co-digestion of municipal sludge with any combination of wastes can result in synergistic, antagonistic or neutral outcomes. The objectives of this study were to identify potential co-digestates, determine synergistic, antagonistic and neutral effects, determine economic benefits, quantify performance of bench scale co-digesters, identify influence of co-digestion on microbial communities and implement appropriate co-digestion, if warranted, after full-scale testing. A market study was used to identify promising co-digestates. Most promising wastes were determined by biochemical methane potential (BMP) and other testing followed by a simple economic analysis. Performance was investigated using bench-scale digesters receiving synthetic primary sludge with and without co-digestates. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analyses were performed on the gene encoding the α subunit of methyl coenzyme M reductase (mcrA) to compare methanogen communities among the digesters. One significant band contributing to the greatest difference in banding patterns was excised, cloned, amplified and sequenced. Full- scale co-digestion was conducted using the most promising co-digestate at South Shore Wastewater Reclamation Facility (Oak Creek, WI). Over 80 wastes were identified from 54 facilities within 160 km of an existing municipal digester. A simple economic comparison identified the greatest benefits for seven co-digestates. Methane production rates of two co- digester systems increased by 105% and 66% in comparison to a control system. These increases were great than anticipated based on theoretical methane production from the additional chemical oxygen demand (P37794) of the co-digestates. Co-digestion of the most promising wastes with primary sludge was estimated to generate enough electricity to power more than 2500 houses. Synergistic outcomes of co-digestion may be caused by chances in microbial community resulting in more rapid methane production rate and higher specific methanogenic activities of the biomass against acetate, propionate and H2 as substrates. The presence of Methanospirillum hungatei correlated to higher SMAs in the Co-Digester 1 system. In subsequent full-scale testing, acid whey in addition to primary sludge increased methane production by 16 %, biogas methane content by 5%, methane yield per VS destroyed by 9% ( from 650 to 710 L CH4 / kg VSdestroyed ) and volatile solids removal by 20%.

1007162	"Analysis of the Isolated SecA DEAD Motor Suggests a Mechanism for Chemical-Mechanical Coupling,""The preprotein cross-linking domain and C-terminal domains of Escherichia coli SecA were removed to create a minimal DEAD motor, SecA-DM. SecA-DM hydrolyzes P22259 and has the same affinity for ADP as full-length SecA. The crystal structure of SecA-DM in complex with ADP was solved and shows the DEAD motor in a closed conformation. Comparison with the structure of the E. coli DEAD motor in an open conformation (Protein Data Bank ID 2FSI) indicates main-chain conformational changes in two critical sequences corresponding to Motif III and Motif V of the DEAD helicase family. The structures that the Motif III and Motif V sequences adopt in the DEAD motor open conformation are incompatible with the closed conformation. Therefore, when the DEAD motor makes the transition from open to closed, Motif III and Motif V are forced to change their conformations, which likely functions to regulate passage through the transition state for P22259 hydrolysis. The transition state for P22259 hydrolysis for the SecA DEAD motor was modeled based on the conformation of the Vasa helicase in complex with adenylyl imidodiphosphate and RNA (Protein Data Bank ID 2DB3). A mechanism for chemical-mechanical coupling emerges, where passage through the transition state for P22259 hydrolysis is hindered by the conformational changes required in Motif III and Motif V, and may be promoted by binding interactions with the preprotein substrate and/or other translocase domains and subunits."""

While the bacterial microbiota of the oropharynx was richer than that of the nostril, the oropharyngeal microbiota varied less among participants than did nostril microbiota. A few phyla accounted for the majority of the bacteria detected at each site: Firmicutes and Actinobacteria in the nostril and Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes in the oropharynx. Compared to culture-independent surveys of microbiota from other body sites, the microbiota of the nostril and oropharynx show distinct phylum-level distribution patterns, supporting niche-specific colonization at discrete anatomical sites. In the nostril, the distribution of Actinobacteria and Firmicutes was reminiscent of that of skin, though Proteobacteria were much less prevalent. The distribution of Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes in the oropharynx was most similar to that in saliva, with more Proteobacteria than in the distal esophagus or mouth. While Firmicutes were prevalent at both sites, distinct families within this phylum dominated numerically in each. At both sites there was an inverse correlation between the prevalences of Firmicutes and another phylum: in the oropharynx, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria, and in the nostril, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria.

Rising antibiotic resistance and few alternative methods of treatment are just two looming problems associated with clinical management of S. aureus. Among numerous virulence factors produced by S. aureus, staphylococcal enterotoxin (SE) B is a secreted protein that binds T-cell receptor and major histocompatibility complex class II, potentially causing toxic shock mediated by pathological activation of T cells. Recombinant monoclonal antibodies that target SEB and block receptor interactions can be of therapeutic value. The inhibitory and biophysical properties of ten human monoclonal antibodies, isolated from a recombinant library by panning against SEB vaccine (STEBVax), were examined as bivalent Fabs and native full-length IgG (Mab). The best performing Fabs had binding affinities equal to polyclonal IgG, low nanomolar IC50s against SEB in cell culture assays, and protected mice from SEB-induced toxic shock. The orthologous staphylococcal proteins, SEC1 and SEC2, as well as streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin C were recognized by several Fabs. Four Fabs against SEB, with the lowest IC50s, were converted into native full-length Mabs. Although SEB-binding kinetics were identical between each Fab and respective Mab, a 250-fold greater inhibition of SEB-induced T-cell activation was observed with two Mabs.

Kinase suppressor of Ras-1 (KSR1) binds each of the three ERK cascade components to facilitate pathway activation. Even though KSR1 contains a C-terminal kinase domain, evidence supporting the catalytic function of KSR1 remains controversial. In this study, we produced recombinant wild-type or kinase-inactive (D683A/D700A) KSR1 proteins in Escherichia coli to test the hypothesis that KSR1 is a functional protein kinase. Recombinant wild-type KSR1, but not recombinant kinase-inactive KSR1, underwent autophosphorylation on serine residue(s), phosphorylated myelin basic protein (P0AEX9) as a generic substrate, and phosphorylated recombinant kinase-inactive MAPK/ERK kinase-1 (MEK1). Furthermore, FLAG immunoprecipitates from KSR1{sup -/-} colon epithelial cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged wild-type KSR1 (+KSR1), but not vector (+vector) or FLAG-tagged kinase-inactive KSR1 (+D683A/D700A), were able to phosphorylate kinase-inactive MEK1. Since TNF activates the ERK pathway in colon epithelial cells, we tested the biological effects of KSR1 in the survival response downstream of TNF. We found that +vector and +D683A/D700A cells underwent apoptosis when treated with TNF, whereas +KSR1 cells were resistant. However, +KSR1 cells were sensitized to TNF-induced cell loss in the absence of MEK kinase activity.

We have solved the crystal structures of the Mtb PII protein in its apo and P22259 bound forms to 1.4 and 2.4 {angstrom} resolutions, respectively. The protein forms a trimeric assembly in the crystal lattice and folds similarly to the other PII family proteins. The Mtb PII:P22259 binary complex structure reveals three P22259 molecules per trimer, each bound between the base of the T-loop of one subunit and the C-loop of the neighboring subunit. In contrast to the apo structure, at least one subunit of the binary complex structure contains a completely ordered T-loop indicating that P22259 binding plays a role in orienting this loop region towards target proteins like the ammonium transporter, AmtB. Arg38 of the T-loop makes direct contact with the {gamma}-phosphate of the P22259 molecule replacing the Mg{sup 2+} position seen in the Methanococcus jannaschii GlnK1 structure. The C-loop of a neighboring subunit encloses the other side of the P22259 molecule, placing the GlnK specific C-terminal 3{sub 10} helix in the vicinity. Homology modeling studies with the E. coli GlnK:AmtB complex reveal that Mtb PII could form a complex similar to the complex in E. coli.

22202464	"Galectin-1 as a fusion partner for the production of soluble and folded human {beta}-1,4-galactosyltransferase-T7 in E. coli,""The expression of recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli often leads to inactive aggregated proteins known as the inclusion bodies. To date, the best available tool has been the use of fusion tags, including the carbohydrate-binding protein; e.g., the maltose-binding protein (P0AEX9) that enhances the solubility of recombinant proteins. However, none of these fusion tags work universally with every partner protein. We hypothesized that galectins, which are also carbohydrate-binding proteins, may help as fusion partners in folding the mammalian proteins in E. coli. Here we show for the first time that a small soluble lectin, human galectin-1, one member of a large galectin family, can function as a fusion partner to produce soluble folded recombinant human glycosyltransferase, {beta}-1,4-galactosyltransferase-7 ({beta}4Gal-T7), in E. coli. The enzyme {beta}4Gal-T7 transfers galactose to xylose during the synthesis of the tetrasaccharide linker sequence attached to a Ser residue of proteoglycans. Without a fusion partner, {beta}4Gal-T7 is expressed in E. coli as inclusion bodies. We have designed a new vector construct, pLgals1, from pET-23a that includes the sequence for human galectin-1, followed by the Tev protease cleavage site, a 6x His-coding sequence, and a multi-cloning site where a cloned gene is inserted. After lactose affinity column purification of galectin-1-{beta}4Gal-T7 fusion protein, the unique protease cleavage site allows the protein {beta}4Gal-T7 to be cleaved from galectin-1 that binds and elutes from UDP-agarose column. The eluted protein is enzymatically active, and shows P06721 spectra comparable to the folded {beta}4Gal-T1.

The genes from D. radiodurans encoding Trx and TrxR were amplified by PCR, inserted into a pET expression vector, and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The overexpressed proteins were purified by metal affinity chromatography, and their activity was demonstrated using well-established assays of insulin precipitation (for Trx), 5,5{prime}-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) reduction, and insulin reduction (for TrxR). In addition, the crystal structure of oxidized TrxR was determined at 1.9-{angstrom} resolution. The overall structure was found to be very similar to that of E. coli TrxR and homodimeric with both P80644- and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-binding domains containing variants of the canonical nucleotide binding fold, the Rossmann fold. The K{sub m} (5.7 {micro}M) of D. radiodurans TrxR for D. radiodurans Trx was determined and is about twofold higher than that of the E. coli thioredoxin system. However, D. radiodurans TrxR has a much lower affinity for E. coli Trx (K{sub m}, 44.4 {micro}M). Subtle differences in the surface charge and shape of the Trx binding site on TrxR may account for the differences in recognition. Because it has been suggested that TrxR from D. radiodurans may have dual cofactor specificity (can utilize both NADH and P80644), D. radiodurans TrxR was tested for its ability to utilize NADH as well.

1626543	"Analysis of the role of PCNA-DNA contacts during clamp loading,""Background: Sliding clamps, such as Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) in eukaryotes, are ring-shaped protein complexes that encircle DNA and enable highly processive DNA replication by serving as docking sites for DNA polymerases. In an P22259-dependent reaction, clamp loader complexes, such as the Replication Factor-C (RFC) complex in eukaryotes, open the clamp and load it around primer-template DNA. Results: We built a model of RFC bound to PCNA and DNA based on existing crystal structures of clamp loaders. This model suggests that DNA would enter the clamp at an angle during clamp loading, thereby interacting with positively charged residues in the center of PCNA. We show that simultaneous mutation of Lys 20, Lys 77, Arg 80, and Arg 149, which interact with DNA in the RFC-PCNA-DNA model, compromises the ability of yeast PCNA to stimulate the DNA-dependent ATPase activity of RFC when the DNA is long enough to extend through the clamp. Fluorescence anisotropy binding experiments show that the inability of the mutant clamp proteins to stimulate RFC ATPase activity is likely caused by reduction in the affinity of the RFC-PCNA complex for DNA. We obtained several crystal forms of yeast PCNA-DNA complexes, measuring X-ray diffraction data to 3.0 Å resolution for one such complex. The resulting electron density maps show that DNA is bound in a tilted orientation relative to PCNA, but makes different contacts than those implicated in clamp loading. Because of apparent partial disorder in the DNA, we restricted refinement of the DNA to a rigid body model. This result contrasts with previous analysis of a bacterial clamp bound to DNA, where the DNA was well resolved. Conclusion: Mutational analysis of PCNA suggests that positively charged residues in the center of the clamp create a binding surface that makes contact with DNA. Disruption of this positive surface, which had not previously been implicated in clamp loading function, reduces RFC ATPase activity in the presence of DNA, most likely by reducing the affinity of RFC and PCNA for DNA.

958954	"Evaluation of Affinity-Tagged Protein Expression Strategies using Local and Global Isotope Ratio Measurements,""Protein enrichments of engineered, affinity-tagged (or bait ) fusion proteins with interaction partners are often laden with background, non-specific proteins, due to interactions that occur in vitro as an artifact of the technique. Furthermore, the in vivo expression of the bait protein may itself affect physiology or metabolism. In this study, intrinsic affinity purification challenges were investigated in a model protein complex, DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RNAP), encompassing chromosome- and plasmid-encoding strategies for bait proteins in two different microbial species: Escherichia coli and Rhodopseudomonas palustris. Isotope ratio measurements of bait protein expression strains relative to native, wild-type strains were performed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-P13009-P13009) to assess bait protein expression strategies in each species. Authentic interacting proteins of RNAP were successfully discerned from artifactual co-isolating proteins by the isotopic differentiation of interactions as random or targeted (I-DIRT) method (A. J. Tackett et al. J. Proteome Res. 2005, 4 (5), 1752-1756). To investigate broader effects of bait protein production in the bacteria, we compared proteomes from strains harboring a plasmid that encodes an affinity-tagged subunit (RpoA) of the RNAP complex with the corresponding wild-type strains using stable isotope metabolic labeling. The ratio of RpoA abundance in plasmid strains versus wild type was 0.8 for R. palustris and 1.7 for E. coli. While most other proteins showed no appreciable difference, proteins significantly increased in abundance in plasmid-encoded bait-expressing strains of both species included the plasmid encoded antibiotic resistance protein, GenR and proteins involved in amino acid biosynthesis. Together, these local, complex-specific and more global, whole proteome isotopic abundance ratio measurements provided a tool for evaluating both in vivo and in vitro effects of plasmid-encoding strategies for bait protein expression. This approach has the potential for enabling discovery of protein-protein interactions among the growing number of sequenced microbial species without the need for development of chromosomal insertion systems."""

Three putative genes, cyaA, cyaB, and cyaC, predicted to encode class I, class IV, and class III adenylate cyclases respectively, have been identified in the genome sequence of this bacterium. Functional validation through complementation of an E. coli cya mutant confirmed that these genes encode proteins with adenylate cyclase activities. Chromosomal deletion of either cyaA or cyaB did not affect anaerobic respiration with fumarate, DMSO, or Fe(III), whereas the deletion of cyaC caused deficiencies in respiration with DMSO and Fe(III), and to a lesser extent with fumarate. A phenotype similar to that of a crp mutant, which lacks the ability to grow anaerobically with DMSO, fumarate, and Fe(III), was obtained when both cyaA and cyaC were deleted. Microarray analysis of gene expression in the crp and the cyaC mutants revealed the involvement of both genes in the regulation of key respiratory pathways such as DMSO, fumarate, and Fe(III) reduction. Additionally, several genes associated with plasmid replication, flagella biosynthesis, and electron transport, were differentially expressed in the cyaC mutant, but not in the crp mutant.

Although P07623 and HTA catalyze similar chemical reactions, these proteins are typically unrelated in both sequence and three-dimensional structure. Here we present the 2.0 {angstrom} resolution x-ray crystal structure of the Bacillus cereus metA protein in complex with homoserine, which provides the first view of a ligand bound to either HTA or P07623. Surprisingly, functional analysis of the B. cereus metA protein shows that it does not use succinyl-CoA as a substrate. Instead, the protein catalyzes the transacetylation of homoserine using acetyl-CoA. Therefore, the B. cereus metA protein functions as an HTA despite greater than 50% sequence identity with bona fide P07623 proteins. This result emphasizes the need for functional confirmation of annotations of enzyme function based on either sequence or structural comparisons. Kinetic analysis of site-directed mutants reveals that the B. cereus metA protein and the E. coli P07623 share a common catalytic mechanism. Structural and functional examination of the B. cereus metA protein reveals that a single amino acid in the active site determines acetyl-CoA (Glu-111) versus succinyl-CoA (Gly-111) specificity in the metA-like of acyltransferases. Switching of this residue provides a mechanism for evolving substrate specificity in bacterial methionine biosynthesis.

It is added to the bacterial O-antigen via a nucleotide-linked version, namely GDP-perosamine. Three enzymes are required for the biosynthesis of GDP-perosamine starting from mannose 1-phosphate. The focus of this investigation is Q7DBF3 from Caulobacter crescentus, which catalyzes the final step in GDP-perosamine synthesis, the conversion of GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose to GDP-perosamine. The enzyme is PLP-dependent and belongs to the aspartate aminotransferase superfamily. It contains the typically conserved active site lysine residue, which forms a Schiff base with the PLP cofactor. Two crystal structures were determined for this investigation: a site-directed mutant protein (K186A) complexed with GDP-perosamine and the wild-type enzyme complexed with an unnatural ligand, GDP-3-deoxyperosamine. These structures, determined to 1.6 and 1.7 {angstrom} resolution, respectively, revealed the manner in which products, and presumably substrates, are accommodated within the active site pocket of Q7DBF3. Additional kinetic analyses using both the natural and unnatural substrates revealed that the K{sub m} for the unnatural substrate was unperturbed relative to that of the natural substrate, but the k{sub cat} was lowered by a factor of approximately 200.

While numerous studies have identified protein partners of the human DNA ligases (hLigs), there has been little characterization of the catalytic properties of these enzymes. In this study, we developed and optimized a fluorescence-based DNA ligation assay to characterize the activities of purified hLigs. Although hLigI joins DNA nicks, it has no detectable activity on linear duplex DNA substrates with short, cohesive single-strand ends. By contrast, hLigIII{beta} and the hLigIII{alpha}/XRCC1 and hLigIV/XRCC4 complexes are active on both nicked and linear duplex DNA substrates. Surprisingly, hLigIV/XRCC4, which is a key component of the major non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway, is significantly less active than hLigIII on a linear duplex DNA substrate. Notably, hLigIV/XRCC4 molecules only catalyze a single ligation event in the absence or presence of P22259. The failure to catalyze subsequent ligation events reflects a defect in the enzyme-adenylation step of the next ligation reaction and suggests that, unless there is an in vivo mechanism to reactivate P15042 IV/XRCC4 following phosphodiester bond formation, the cellular NHEJ capacity will be determined by the number of adenylated DNA ligaseIV/XRCC4 molecules."""

1625436	"From one amino acid to another: P0A873-dependent amino acid biosynthesis,""Aminoacyl-tRNAs (aa-tRNAs) are the essential substrates for translation. Most aa-tRNAs are formed by direct aminoacylation of P0A873 catalyzed by aminoacyl-P0A873 synthetases. However, a smaller number of aa-tRNAs (Asn-P0A873, Gln-P0A873, Cys-P0A873 and Sec-P0A873) are made by synthesizing the amino acid on the P0A873 by first attaching a non-cognate amino acid to the P0A873, which is then converted to the cognate one catalyzed by tRNAdependent modifying enzymes. Asn-P0A873 or Gln-P0A873 formation in most prokaryotes requires amidation of Asp-P0A873 or Glu-P0A873 by amidotransferases that couple an amidase or an asparaginase to liberate ammonia with a tRNAdependent kinase. Both archaeal and eukaryotic Sec-P0A873 biosynthesis and Cys-P0A873 synthesis in methanogens require O-phosophoseryl-P0A873 formation.

Our studies have suggested a vital role for the cytosolic chaperone Cdc48p/p97 during cytokinesis and cell expansion which are highly dependent upon secretory membrane trafficking. Localization studies have shown that the plant Cdc48p/p97, AtCDC48, and the Arabidopsis ortholog of the ER- and Golgi-associated SNARE, syntaxin 5, (referred to as SYP31) are targeted to the division plane during cytokinesis.  In addition, AtCDC48 and SYP31 were shown to interact in vitro and in vivo.  To characterize further the function of AtCDC48 and SYP31 we have utilized affinity chromatography and MALDI-P13009 to identify several plant-specific proteins that interact with SYP31 and/or modulate the activity of AtCDC48 including two UBX (i.e. ubiquitin-like) domain containing proteins, PUX1 and PUX2 (Proteins containing UBX domain).  These proteins define a plant protein family consisting of 15 uncharacterized members that we postulate interact with AtCDC48. Biochemical studies have demonstrated that PUX2 is a novel membrane adapter for AtCDC48 that mediates AtCDC48/SYP31 interaction and is likely to control AtCDC48-dependent membrane fusion.  In contrast, PUX1 negatively regulates AtCDC48 by inhibiting its ATPase activity and by promoting the disassembly of the active hexamer.  These findings provide the first evidence that the assembly and disassembly of the CDC48/p97complex is actually a dynamic process.  This new unexpected level of regulation for CDC48/p97 was demonstrated to be critical in vivo as pux1 loss-of-function mutants grow faster than wild-type plants.  These studies suggest a role for AtCDC48 in plant cell cycle progression including cytokinesis and/or cell expansion.

However, knowledge is incomplete about other biological pathways that respond to changes in iron concentration, as well as details of the responses. In this work, we integrate physiological, transcriptomics and genetic approaches to delineate the iron response of S. oneidensis. Results: We show that the iron response in S. oneidensis is a rapid process. Temporal gene expression profiles were examined for iron depletion and repletion, and a gene co-expression network was reconstructed. Modules of iron acquisition systems, anaerobic energy metabolism and protein degradation were the most noteworthy in the gene network. Bioinformatics analyses suggested that genes in each of the modules might be regulated by DNA-binding proteins Fur, P0ACJ8 and RpoH, respectively. Closer inspection of these modules revealed a transcriptional regulator (SO2426) involved in iron acquisition and ten transcriptional factors involved in anaerobic energy metabolism. Selected genes in the network were analyzed by genetic studies. Disruption of genes encoding a putative alcaligin biosynthesis protein (SO3032) and a gene previously implicated in protein degradation (SO2017) led to severe growth deficiency under iron depletion conditions. Disruption of a novel transcriptional factor (SO1415) caused deficiency in both anaerobic iron reduction and growth with thiosulfate or TMAO as an electronic acceptor, suggesting that SO1415 is required for specific branches of anaerobic energy metabolism pathways. Conclusions: Using a reconstructed gene network, we identified major biological pathways that were differentially expressed during iron depletion and repletion.

Vaccinia virus, which is the prototype of poxviruses, encodes a P12295 (vvUDG) that is significantly different from the UDGs of other organisms in primary, secondary and tertiary structure and characteristic motifs. It adopted a novel catalysis-independent role in DNA replication that involves interaction with a viral protein, A20, to form the processivity factor. P12295:A20 association is essential for assembling of the processive DNA polymerase complex. The structure of the protein must have provisions for such interactions with A20. This paper provides the first glimpse into the structure of a poxvirus P12295. Results: Results of dynamic light scattering experiments and native size exclusion chromatography showed that vvUDG is a dimer in solution. The dimeric assembly is also maintained in two crystal forms. The core of vvUDG is reasonably well conserved but the structure contains one additional β-sheet at each terminus. A glycerol molecule is found in the active site of the enzyme in both crystal forms. Interaction of this glycerol molecule with the protein possibly mimics the enzyme substrate (uracil) interactions. Conclusion: The crystal structures reveal several distinctive features of vvUDG. The new structural features may have evolved for adopting novel functions in the replication machinery of poxviruses.

A microarray consists of multiple DNA oligonucleotide probes that, under high stringency conditions, hybridize only to specific complementary nucleic acid sequences (targets). A fluorescent signal indicates the presence and, in many cases, the abundance of genetic regions of interest. In this chapter we will look at how microarrays are used in microbial ecology, especially with the recent increase in microbial community DNA sequence data. Of particular interest to microbial ecologists, phylogenetic microarrays are used for the analysis of phylotypes in a community and functional gene arrays are used for the analysis of functional genes, and, by inference, phylotypes in environmental samples. A phylogenetic microarray that has been developed by the Andersen laboratory, the PhyloChip, will be discussed as an example of a microarray that targets the known diversity within the A8C927 gene to determine microbial community composition. Using multiple, confirmatory probes to increase the confidence of detection and a mismatch probe for every perfect match probe to minimize the effect of cross-hybridization by non-target regions, the PhyloChip is able to simultaneously identify any of thousands of taxa present in an environmental sample. The PhyloChip is shown to reveal greater diversity within a community than rRNA gene sequencing due to the placement of the entire gene product on the microarray compared with the analysis of up to thousands of individual molecules by traditional sequencing methods.

We first demonstrated that chemiluminescence (P06721) imaging can be used to interrogate single bacterial cells. While using a luminometer allows detecting P22259 from cell lysate extracted from at least 10 bacterial cells, all previous cell P06721 detection never reached this sensitivity of single bacteria level. We approached this goal with a different strategy from before: instead of breaking bacterial cell membrane and trying to capture the transiently diluted P22259 with the firefly luciferase P06721 assay, we introduced the firefly luciferase enzyme into bacteria using the modern genetic techniques and placed the P06721 reaction substrate D-luciferin outside the cells. By damaging the cell membrane with various antibacterial drugs including antibiotics such as Penicillins and bacteriophages, the D-luciferin molecules diffused inside the cell and initiated the reaction that produces P06721 light. As firefly luciferases are large protein molecules which are retained within the cells before the total rupture and intracellular P22259 concentration is high at the millmolar level, the P06721 reaction of firefly luciferase, P22259 and D-luciferin can be kept for a relatively long time within the cells acting as a reaction container to generate enough photons for detection by the extremely sensitive intensified charge coupled device (ICCD) camera. The result was inspiring as various single bacterium lysis and leakage events were monitored with 10-s temporal resolution movies. We also found a new way of enhancing diffusion D-luciferin into cells by dehydrating the bacteria. Then we started with this novel single bacterial P06721 imaging technique, and applied it for quantifying gene expression levels from individual bacterial cells. Previous published result in single cell gene expression quantification mainly used a fluorescence method; P06721 detection is limited because of the difficulty to introduce enough D-luciferin molecules. Since dehydration could easily cause proper size holes in bacterial cell membranes and facilitate D-luciferin diffusion, we used this method and recorded P06721 from individual cells each hour after induction. The P06721 light intensity from each individual cell was integrated and gene expression levels of two strain types were compared. Based on our calculation, the overall sensitivity of our system is already approaching the single enzyme level. The median enzyme number inside a single bacterium from the higher expression strain after 2 hours induction was quantified to be about 550 molecules. Finally we imaged P22259 release from astrocyte cells. Upon mechanical stimulation, astrocyte cells respond by increasing intracellular Ca <sup>2+</sup> level and releasing P22259 to extracellular spaces as signaling molecules. The P22259 release imaged by direct P06721 imaging using free firefly luciferase and D-luciferin outside cells reflects the transient release as well as rapid P22259 diffusion. Therefore P22259 release detection at the cell surface is critical to study the P22259 release mechanism and signaling propagation pathway. We realized this cell surface localized P22259 release imaging detection by immobilizing firefly luciferase to streptavidin beads that attached to the cell surface via streptavidin-biotin interactions. Both intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> propagation wave and extracellular P22259 propagation wave at the cell surface were recorded with fluorescence and P06721 respectively. The results imply that at close distances from the stimulation center (&lt;120 μm) extracellular P22259 pathway is faster, while at long distances (&gt;120 μm) intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling through gap junctions seems more effective."""

1006527	"Structure of the Bacteriophage [phi]KZ Lytic Transglycosylase gp144,""Lytic transglycosylases are enzymes that act on the peptidoglycan of bacterial cell walls. They cleave the glycosidic linkage between N-acetylmuramoyl and N-acetylglucosaminyl residues with the concomitant formation of a 1,6-anhydromuramoyl product. The x-ray structure of the lytic transglycosylase gp144 from the Pseudomonas bacteriophage {phi}KZ has been determined to 2.5-{angstrom} resolution. This protein is probably employed by the bacteriophage in the late stage of the virus reproduction cycle to destroy the bacterial cell wall to release the phage progeny. {phi}KZ gp144 is a 260-residue {alpha}-helical protein composed of a 70-residue N-terminal cell wall-binding domain and a C-terminal catalytic domain. The fold of the N-terminal domain is similar to the peptidoglycan-binding domain from Streptomyces albus G d-Ala-d-Ala carboxypeptidase and to the N-terminal prodomain of human metalloproteinases that act on extracellular matrices. The C-terminal catalytic domain of gp144 has a structural similarity to the catalytic domain of the transglycosylase P0AGC3 from Escherichia coli and to lysozymes. The gp144 catalytic domain has an elongated groove that can bind at least five sugar residues at sites A-E. As in other lysozymes, the peptidoglycan cleavage (catalyzed by Glu{sup 115} in gp144) occurs between sugar-binding subsites D and E. The x-ray structure of the {phi}KZ transglycosylase complexed with the chitotetraose (N-acetylglucosamine){sub 4} has been determined to 2.6-{angstrom} resolution.

This strain has been reported to contain a truncated carbon catabolite repressor gene cre1 and is consequently carbon catabolite derepressed. To date this and an additional frame-shift mutation in the glycoprotein-processing βglucosidase II encoding gene are the only known genetic differences in strain RUT C30. Results: In the present paper we show that H. jecorina RUT C30 lacks an 85 kb genomic fragment, and consequently misses additional 29 genes comprising transcription factors, enzymes of the primary metabolism and transport proteins. This loss is already present in the ancestor of RUT C30 – NG 14 – and seems to have occurred in a palindromic P30870-rich repeat (PATRR) typically inducing chromosomal translocations, and is not linked to the cre1 locus. The mutation of the cre1 locus has specifically occurred in RUT C30. Some of the genes that are lacking in RUT C30 could be correlated with pronounced alterations in its phenotype, such as poor growth on α-linked oligoand polyglucosides (loss of maltose permease), or disturbance of osmotic homeostasis.

Although several structures of ZnuA and its homologs have been determined, details regarding metal ion stoichiometry, affinity, and specificity as well as the mechanism of metal uptake and transfer remain unclear. The crystal structures of E. coli ZnuA (Eco-ZnuA) in the apo, Zn(2+)-bound, and Co(2+)-bound forms have been determined. ZnZnuA binds at least two metal ions. The first, observed previously in other structures, is coordinated tetrahedrally by Glu59, His60, His143, and His207. Replacement of Zn(2+) with Co(2+) results in almost identical coordination geometry at this site. The second metal binding site involves His224 and several yet to be identified residues from the His-rich loop that is unique to Zn(2+) periplasmic metal binding receptors. Electron paramagnetic resonance and X-ray absorption spectroscopic data on CoZnuA provide additional insight into possible residues involved in this second site. The second site is also detected by metal analysis and circular dichroism (P06721) titrations. Eco-ZnuA binds Zn(2+) (estimated K (d) &lt; 20 nM), Co(2+), Ni(2+), Cu(2+), Cu(+), and Cd(2+), but not Mn(2+).

1629839	"A new classification system for bacterial Rieske non-heme iron aromatic ring-hydroxylating oxygenases,""Background: Rieske non-heme iron aromatic ring-hydroxylating oxygenases (RHOs) are multi-component enzyme systems that are remarkably diverse in bacteria isolated from diverse habitats. Since the first classification in 1990, there has been a need to devise a new classification scheme for these enzymes because many RHOs have been discovered, which do not belong to any group in the previous classification. Here, we present a scheme for classification of RHOs reflecting new sequence information and interactions between RHO enzyme components. Result: We have analyzed a total of 130 RHO enzymes in which 25 well-characterized RHO enzymes were used as standards to test our hypothesis for the proposed classification system. From the sequence analysis of electron transport chain (ETC) components of the standard RHOs, we extracted classification keys that reflect not only the phylogenetic affiliation within each component but also relationship among components. Oxygenase components of standard RHOs were phylogenetically classified into 10 groups with the classification keys derived from ETC components. This phylogenetic classification scheme was converted to a new systematic classification consisting of 5 distinct types. The new classification system was statistically examined to justify its stability. Type I represents two-component RHO systems that consist of an oxygenase and an P28861<sub>C</sub>-type reductase. Type II contains other two-component RHO systems that consist of an oxygenase and an P28861<sub>N</sub>-type reductase. Type III represents a group of three-component RHO systems that consist of an oxygenase, a [2Fe-2S]-type ferredoxin and an FNRN-type reductase. Type IV represents another three-component systems that consist of oxygenase, [2Fe-2S]-type ferredoxin and P06715-type reductase. Type V represents another different three-component systems that consist of an oxygenase, a [3Fe-4S]-type ferredoxin and a P06715-type reductase. Conclusion: The new classification system provides the following features. First, the new classification system analyzes RHO enzymes as a whole. RwithSecond, the new classification system is not static but responds dynamically to the growing pool of RHO enzymes. Third, our classification can be applied reliably to the classification of incomplete RHOs. Fourth, the classification has direct applicability to experimental work.

Though B. juncea lacks the ability to hyperaccumulate metals, its relatively high biomass, rapid growth and relatedness to true metal hyperaccumulating plants makes it a promising starting point for the development of plants for phytoremediation. Our goal in this study is to determine the transcriptional regulation of MTP1 in order to start to better understanding the physiological role of MTP1 in B. juncea. Steady-state mRNA levels of BjMTP1 were found to be enhanced 8.8, 5.9, and 1.6-fold in five-day-old B. juncea seedlings after exposure to Ni<sup>2+</sup>, Cd<sup>2+</sup> or Zn<sup>2+</sup>, respectively. This was also reflected in enhanced P05804 activity in B. juncea seedlings transformed with BjMTP1 promoter::GUSPlus after exposure to these metals over a similar range of toxicities from mild to severe. However, no increase in P05804 activity was observed after exposure of seedlings to cold or heat stress, NaCl or hydrogen peroxide. P05804 expression in Ni2+ treated seedlings was localized in roots, particularly in the root-shoot transition zone.

Toward understanding this metal ion-specific response, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) analysis of various M-NikR complexes (M = Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II), Cu(I), and Zn(II)) was used to show that each high-affinity binding site metal adopts a unique structure, with Ni(II) and Cu(II) being the only two metal ions to feature planar four-coordinate complexes. The results are consistent with an allosteric mechanism whereby the geometry and ligand selection of the metal present in the high-affinity site induce a unique conformation in NikR that subsequently influences DNA binding. The influence of the high-affinity metal on protein structure was examined using hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange detected by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-P13009). Each NikR complex gives rise to differing amounts of H/D exchange; Zn(II)- and Co(II)-NikR are most like apo-NikR, while the exchange time course is substantially different for Ni(II) and to a lesser extent for Cu(II). In addition to the high-affinity metal binding site, E. coli NikR has a low-affinity metal-binding site that affects DNA binding affinity. We have characterized this low-affinity site using XAS in heterobimetallic complexes of NikR. When Cu(II) occupies the high-affinity site and Ni(II) occupies the low-affinity site, the Ni K-edge XAS spectra show that the Ni site is composed of six N/O-donors.

971176	"Reducing Open Cell Landfill Methane Emissions with a Bioactive Alternative Daily,""Methane and carbon dioxide are formed in landfills as wastes degrade. Molecule-for-molecule, methane is about 20 times more potent than carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the earth's atmosphere, and thus, it is the methane emissions from landfills that are scrutinized. For example, if emissions composed of 60% methane and 40% carbon dioxide were changed to a mix that was 40% methane and 60% carbon dioxide, a 30% reduction in the landfill's global warming potential would result. A 10% methane, 90% carbon dioxide ratio will result in a 75% reduction in global warming potential compared to the baseline. Gas collection from a closed landfill can reduce emissions, and it is sometimes combined with a biocover, an engineered system where methane oxidizing bacteria living in a medium such as compost, convert landfill methane to carbon dioxide and water. Although methane oxidizing bacteria merely convert one greenhouse gas (methane) to another (carbon dioxide), this conversion can offer significant reductions in the overall greenhouse gas contribution, or global warming potential, associated with the landfill. What has not been addressed to date is the fact that methane can also escape from a landfill when the active cell is being filled with waste. Federal regulations require that newly deposited solid waste to be covered daily with a 6 in layer of soil or an alternative daily cover (P21170), such as a canvas tarp. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of immobilizing methane oxidizing bacteria into a tarp-like matrix that could be used for alternative daily cover at open landfill cells to prevent methane emissions. A unique method of isolating methanotrophs from landfill cover soil was used to create a liquid culture of mixed methanotrophs. A variety of prospective immobilization techniques were used to affix the bacteria in a tarp-like matrix. Both gel encapsulation of methanotrophs and gels with liquid cores containing methanotrophs were readily made but prone to rapid desiccation. Bacterial adsorption onto foam padding, natural sponge, and geotextile was successful. The most important factor for success appeared to be water holding capacity. Prototype biotarps made with geotextiles plus adsorbed methane oxidizing bacteria were tested for their responses to temperature, intermittent starvation, and washing (to simulate rainfall). The prototypes were mesophilic, and methane oxidation activity remained strong after one cycle of starvation but then declined with repeated cycles. Many of the cells detached with vigorous washing, but at least 30% appeared resistant to sloughing. While laboratory landfill simulations showed that four-layer composite biotarps made with two different types of geotextile could remove up to 50% of influent methane introduced at a flux rate of 22 g m{sup -2} d{sup -1}, field experiments did not yield high activity levels. Tests revealed that there were high hour-to-hour flux variations in the field, which, together with frequent rainfall events, confounded the field testing. Overall, the findings suggest that a methanotroph embedded biotarp appears to be a feasible strategy to mitigate methane emission from landfill cells, although the performance of field-tested biotarps was not robust here. Tarps will likely be best suited for spring and summer use, although the methane oxidizer population may be able to shift and adapt to lower temperatures. The starvation cycling of the tarp may require the capacity for intermittent reinoculation of the cells, although it is also possible that a subpopulation will adapt to the cycling and become dominant. Rainfall is not expected to be a major factor, because a baseline biofilm will be present to repopulate the tarp. If strong performance can be achieved and documented, the biotarp concept could be extended to include interception of other compounds beyond methane, such as volatile aromatic hydrocarbons and chlorinated solvents."""

The placement of Salinibacter ruber with other Bacteroidetes species was not resolved by other phylogenetic methods, but this affiliation was strongly supported by the character compatibility approach. The molecular signatures described here provide novel tools for identifying and circumscribing species from the Bacteroidetes and Chlorobi phyla as well as some of their main groups in clear terms. These results also provide strong evidence that species from these two phyla (and also possibly Fibrobacteres) are specifically related to each other and they form a single superphylum.

1052137	"WHERE MULTIFUNCTIONAL DNA REPAIR PROTEINS MEET: MAPPING THE INTERACTION DOMAINS BETWEEN XPG AND WRN,""The rapid recognition and repair of DNA damage is essential for the maintenance of genomic integrity and cellular  survival. Multiple complex and interconnected DNA damage responses exist within cells to preserve the human  genome, and these repair pathways are carried out by a specifi c interplay of protein-protein interactions. Thus a  failure in the coordination of these processes, perhaps brought about by a breakdown in any one multifunctional  repair protein, can lead to genomic instability, developmental and immunological abnormalities, cancer and premature  aging. This study demonstrates a novel interaction between two such repair proteins, Xeroderma pigmentosum  group G protein (XPG) and Werner syndrome helicase (WRN), that are both highly pleiotropic and associated with  inherited genetic disorders when mutated. XPG is a structure-specifi c endonuclease required for the repair of  UV-damaged DNA by nucleotide excision repair (NER), and mutations in XPG result in the diseases Xeroderma  pigmentosum (XP) and Cockayne syndrome (P12008). A loss of XPG incision activity results in XP, whereas a loss of  non-enzymatic function(s) of XPG causes P12008. WRN is a multifunctional protein involved in double-strand break  repair (DSBR), and consists of 3’–5’ DNA-dependent helicase, 3’–5’ exonuclease, and single-strand DNA annealing  activities. Nonfunctional WRN protein leads to Werner syndrome, a premature aging disorder with increased cancer  incidence. Far Western analysis was used to map the interacting domains between XPG and WRN by denaturing  gel electrophoresis, which separated purifi ed full length and recombinant XPG and WRN deletion constructs, based  primarily upon the length of each polypeptide. Specifi c interacting domains were visualized when probed with the  secondary protein of interest which was then detected by traditional Western analysis using the antibody of the  secondary protein. The interaction between XPG and WRN was mapped to the C-terminal region of XPG as well  as the C-terminal region of WRN. The physical interaction between XPG and WRN links NER, (made evident by  the disease XP) with DSBR, which imparts additional knowledge of the overlapping nature of these two proteins  and the previously distinct DNA repair pathways they are associated with. Since genomic integrity is constantly  threatened by both endogenous and exogenous (internal and external) damage, understanding the roles of these  proteins in coordinating DNA repair processes with replication will signifi cantly further understanding how defects  instigate physiological consequences in response to various DNA damaging sources. This ultimately contributes  to our understanding of cancer and premature aging."""	Journal of Undergraduate Research	"('P12008', 'CS')"

1626375	"Evolution of competence and DNA uptake specificity in the Pasteurellaceae,""Background: Many bacteria can take up DNA, but the evolutionary history and function of natural competence and transformation remain obscure. The sporadic distribution of competence suggests it is frequently lost and/or gained, but this has not been examined in an explicitly phylogenetic context. Additional insight may come from the sequence specificity of uptake by species such as Haemophilus influenzae, where a 9 bp uptake signal sequence (USS) repeat is both highly overrepresented in the genome and needed for efficient DNA uptake. We used the distribution of competence genes and DNA uptake specificity in H. influenzae's family, the Pasteurellaceae, to examine the ancestry of competence. Results: A phylogeny of the Pasteurellaceae based on 12 protein coding genes from species with sequenced genomes shows two strongly supported subclades: the Hin subclade (H. influenzae, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Pasteurella multocida, Mannheimia succiniciproducens, and H. somnus), and the Apl subclade (A. pleuropneumoniae, M. haemolytica, and H. ducreyi). All species contained homologues of all known H. influenzae competence genes, consistent with an ancestral origin of competence. Competence gene defects were identified in three species (H. somnus, H. ducreyi and M. haemolytica); each appeared to be of recent origin. The assumption that USS arise by mutation rather than copying was first confirmed using alignments of H. influenzae proteins with distant homologues. Abundant USS-like repeats were found in all eight Pasteurellacean genomes; the repeat consensuses of species in the Hin subclade were identical to that of H. influenzae (AAGTGCGGT), whereas members of the Apl subclade shared the consensus ACAAGCGGT. All species' USSs had the strong consensus and flanking P30870-rich repeats of H. influenzae USSs. DNA uptake and competition experiments demonstrated that the Apl-type repeat is a true USS distinct from the Hin-type USS: A. pleuropneumoniae preferentially takes up DNA fragments containing the Apl-type USS over both H. influenzae and unrelated DNAs, and H. influenzae prefers its own USS over the Apl type. Conclusion: Competence and DNA uptake specificity are ancestral properties of the Pasteurellaceae, with divergent USSs and uptake specificity distinguishing only the two major subclades. The conservation of most competence genes over the ~350 million year history of the family suggests that lineages that lose competence may be evolutionary dead ends."""

975368	"Genomic Sequencing of Single Microbial Cells from Environmental Samples,""Recently developed techniques allow genomic DNA sequencing from single microbial cells [Lasken P0AFU8: Single-cell genomic sequencing using multiple displacement amplification, Curr Opin Microbiol 2007, 10:510-516]. Here, we focus on research strategies for putting these methods into practice in the laboratory setting. An immediate consequence of single-cell sequencing is that it provides an alternative to culturing organisms as a prerequisite for genomic sequencing. The microgram amounts of DNA required as template are amplified from a single bacterium by a method called multiple displacement amplification (MDA) avoiding the need to grow cells. The ability to sequence DNA from individual cells will likely have an immense impact on microbiology considering the vast numbers of novel organisms, which have been inaccessible unless culture-independent methods could be used. However, special approaches have been necessary to work with amplified DNA. MDA may not recover the entire genome from the single copy present in most bacteria. Also, some sequence rearrangements can occur during the DNA amplification reaction. Over the past two years many research groups have begun to use MDA, and some practical approaches to single-cell sequencing have been developed. We review the consensus that is emerging on optimum methods, reliability of amplified template, and the proper interpretation of 'composite' genomes which result from the necessity of combining data from several single-cell MDA reactions in order to complete the assembly. Preferred laboratory methods are considered on the basis of experience at several large sequencing centers where &gt;70% of genomes are now often recovered from single cells.

(2006) Biochemistry 45, 11278-89]. In this report we demonstrate that CoASH is the major thiol in Bacillus anthracis; a bioinformatics analysis indicates that three of the four proteins responsible for the conversion of pantothenate (Pan) to CoASH in Escherichia coli are conserved in B. anthracis. In contrast, a novel type III pantothenate kinase (PanK) catalyzes the first committed step in the biosynthetic pathway in B. anthracis; unlike the E. coli type I PanK, this enzyme is not subject to feedback inhibition by CoASH. The crystal structure of B. anthracis PanK (BaPanK), solved using multiwavelength anomalous dispersion data and refined at a resolution of 2.0 {angstrom}, demonstrates that BaPanK is a new member of the Acetate and Sugar Kinase/Hsc70/Actin (ASKHA) superfamily. The Pan and P22259 substrates have been modeled into the active-site cleft; in addition to providing a clear rationale for the absence of CoASH inhibition, analysis of the Pan-binding pocket has led to the development of two new structure-based motifs (the PAN and INTERFACE motifs).

934731	"Coordinateendonucleolytic 5&#39; and 3&#39; trimming of terminally blocked blunt DNA double-strand break ends by Artemis nuclease and DNA-dependent protein kinase,""Previous work showed that, in the presence of DNA-PK, Artemis slowly trims 3'-phosphoglycolate-terminated blunt ends. To examine the trimming reaction in more detail, long internally labeled DNA substrates were treated with Artemis. In the absence of DNA-PK, Artemis catalyzed extensive 5' {yields} 3' exonucleolytic resection of double-stranded DNA. This resection required a 5'-phosphate but did not require P22259, and was accompanied by endonucleolytic cleavage of the resulting 3' overhang. In the presence of DNA-PK, Artemis-mediated trimming was more limited, was P22259-dependent, and did not require a 5'-phosphate. For a blunt end with either a 3'-phosphoglycolate or 3'-hydroxyl terminus, endonucleolytic trimming of 2-4 nucleotides from the 3'-terminal strand was accompanied by trimming of 6 nucleotides from the 5'-terminal strand. The results suggest that autophosphorylated DNA-PK suppresses the exonuclease activity of Artemis toward blunt-ended DNA, and promotes slow and limited endonucleolytic trimming of the 5'-terminal strand, resulting in short 3' overhangs that are trimmed endonucleolytically. Thus, Artemis and DNA-PK can convert terminally blocked DNA ends of diverse geometry and chemical structure to a form suitable for polymerase mediated patching and ligation, with minimal loss of terminal sequence. Such processing could account for the very small deletions often found at DNA double-strand break repair sites."""	Nucleic Acids Research	"('P22259', 'ATP')"

As a first step towards understanding the biological role of E protein during PRRSV replication, E gene expression was blocked in a full-length infectious clone by mutating the ATG translational initiation to GTG, such that the full-length mutant genomic clone was unable to synthesize the E protein. DNA transfection of PRRSV-susceptible cells with the E gene knocked-out genomic clone showed the absence of virus infectivity. P129-{delta}E-transfected cells however produced virion particles in the culture supernatant, and these particles contained viral genomic RNA, demonstrating that the E protein is essential for PRRSV infection but dispensable for virion assembly. Electron microscopy suggests that the P129-{delta}E virions assembled in the absence of E had a similar appearance to the wild-type particles. Strand-specific P0DV86-PCR demonstrated that the E protein-negative, non-infectious P129-{delta}E virus particles were able to enter cells but further steps of replication were interrupted. The entry of PRRSV has been suggested to be via receptor-mediated endocytosis, and lysomotropic basic compounds and known ion-channel blocking agents both inhibited PRRSV replication effectively during the uncoating process. The expression of E protein in Escherichia coli-mediated cell growth arrests and increased the membrane permeability. Cross-linking experiments in cells infected with PRRSV or transfected with E gene showed that the E protein was able to form homo-oligomers. Taken together, our data suggest that the PRRSV E protein is likely an ion-channel protein embedded in the viral envelope and facilitates uncoating of virus and release of the genome in the cytoplasm."""

To overcome this problem, we have used a high-throughput peptide screen to identify an alternate binding motif (i.e., CCKACC  or KA tag), which has a similar brightness to the classical sequence upon P0AE18 binding, but displays altered rates and affinities of association that permit the differential labeling of these peptide sequences by the red probe 4,5-bis(1,3,2-dithiarsolan-2-yl)-resorufin (ReAsH-EDT2) or its green cognate 4’,5’-bis(1,3,2-dithoarsolan-2-yl)fluorescein-(1,2-ethanedithiol)2 (FLAsH-EDT2).

Results: Phylogenetic relationships of TyrA domains were evaluated in the context of combinatorial patterns of specificity for the two substrates, as well as the presence or absence of a variety of fusions. An interactive tool is provided for prediction of substrate specificity. Interactive alignments for a suite of catalytic-core TyrA domains of differing specificity are also provided to facilitate phylogenetic analysis. tyrA membership in apparent operons (or supraoperons) was examined, and patterns of conserved synteny in relationship to organismal positions on the A8C927 tree were ascertained for members of the domain Bacteria.

The resulting model is consistent with the roles of Arg419 in orienting the substrate to PLP and acidifying the {alpha}-proton of the substrate for {beta}-elimination, Lys269 in the formation and decomposition of the PLP quinonoid intermediate, Arg230 in orienting the substrate-PLP intermediates in the optimal conformation for catalysis, and His463 and Tyr74 in determining substrate specificity and suggests that the closed conformation observed in the structure could be induced by substrate binding and that significant conformational changes occur during catalysis. A catalytic mechanism for tryptophanase is proposed. Since E. coli tryptophanase has resisted forming diffraction-quality crystals for many years, the molecular surface of tryptophanase has been analyzed in various crystal forms and it was rationalized that strong crystal contacts occur on the flat surface of the protein and that the size of crystal contact surface seems to correlate with the diffraction quality of the crystal."""

927875	"Interspecific Comparison and annotation of two complete mitochondrial genome sequences from the plant pathogenic fungus Mycosphaerella graminicola,""The mitochondrial genomes of two isolates of the wheat pathogen Mycosphaerella graminicola were sequenced completely and compared to identify polymorphic regions. This organism is of interest because it is phylogenetically distant from other fungi with sequenced mitochondrial genomes and it has shown discordant patterns of nuclear and mitochondrial diversity. The mitochondrial genome of M. graminicola is a circular molecule of approximately 43,960 bp containing the typical genes coding for 14 proteins related to oxidative phosphorylation, one RNA polymerase, two rRNA genes and a set of 27 tRNAs. The mitochondrial DNA of M. graminicola lacks the gene encoding the putative ribosomal protein (rps5-like), commonly found in fungal mitochondrial genomes. Most of the P0A873 genes were clustered with a gene order conserved with many other ascomycetes. A sample of thirty-five additional strains representing the known global mt diversity was partially sequenced to measure overall mitochondrial variability within the species. Little variation was found, confirming previous RFLP-based findings of low mitochondrial diversity. The mitochondrial sequence of M. graminicola is the first reported from the family Mycosphaerellaceae or the order Capnodiales. The sequence also provides a tool to better understand the development of fungicide resistance and the conflicting pattern of high nuclear and low mitochondrial diversity in global populations of this fungus."""

1627135	"<strong>Cobalamin-Independent Methionine Synthase (MetE): A Face-to-Face Double Barrel That Evolved by Gene Duplication</strong>,""P25665 (MetE) catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from methyltetrahydrofolate to L-homocysteine (Hcy) without using an intermediate methyl carrier. Although MetE displays no detectable sequence homology with cobalamin-dependent methionine synthase (MetH), both enzymes require zinc for activation and binding of Hcy. Crystallographic analyses of MetE from T. maritima reveal an unusual dual-barrel structure in which the active site lies between the tops of the two (βα)<sub>8</sub> barrels. The fold of the N-terminal barrel confirms that it has evolved from the C-terminal polypeptide by gene duplication; comparisons of the barrels provide an intriguing example of homologous domain evolution in which binding sites are obliterated. The C-terminal barrel incorporates the zinc ion that binds and activates Hcy. The zinc-binding site in MetE is distinguished from the (Cys)<sub>3</sub>Zn site in the related enzymes, MetH and betaine–homocysteine methyltransferase, by its position in the barrel and by the metal ligands, which are histidine, cysteine, glutamate, and cysteine in the resting form of MetE. Hcy associates at the face of the metal opposite glutamate, which moves away from the zinc in the binary E∙Hcy complex. The folate substrate is not intimately associated with the N-terminal barrel; instead, elements from both barrels contribute binding determinants in a binary complex in which the folate substrate is incorrectly oriented for methyl transfer. Atypical locations of the Hcy and folate sites in the C-terminal barrel presumably permit direct interaction of the substrates in a ternary complex. Structures of the binary substrate complexes imply that rearrangement of folate, perhaps accompanied by domain rearrangement, must occur before formation of a ternary complex that is competent for methyl transfer."""

The measured labeledacetate uptake rate was 21 mmol/gdw/h in the exponential growth phase.The resulting isotope labeling pattern of amino acids allowed an accuratedetermination of the in vivo global metabolic reaction rates (fluxes)through the central metabolic pathways using a computational isotopomermodel. The tracer experiments showed that G. metallireducens containedcomplete biosynthesis pathways for essential metabolism, and this strainmight also have an unusual isoleucine biosynthesis route (usingacetyl-CoA and pyruvate as the precursors). The model indicated that over90 percent of the acetate was completely oxidized to CO2 via a completetricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle while reducing iron. Pyruvate carboxylaseand phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase were present under theseconditions, but enzymes in the glyoxylate shunt and malic enzyme wereabsent. Gluconeogenesis and the pentose phosphate pathway were mainlyemployed for biosynthesis and accounted for less than 3 percent of totalcarbon consumption. The model also indicated surprisingly highreversibility in the reaction between oxoglutarate and succinate. Thisstep operates close to the thermodynamic equilibrium possibly becausesuccinate is synthesized via a transferase reaction, and the conversionof oxoglutarate to succinate is a rate limiting step for carbonmetabolism.

P00864 is an anaplerotic enzyme, but it may also contribute to overall CO2 fixation through Î²-carboxylation reactions. A consensus sequence generated by aligning the pepc genes of Anabaena variabilis, Anacystis nidulans and Synechocystis PCC 6803 was used to design two sets of primers that were used to amplify segments of Synechococcus PCC 7002 pepc. In order to isolate the gene, the sequence of the PCR product was used to search for the pepc nucleotide sequence from the publicly available genome of Synechococcus PCC 7002. At the time, the genome for this organism had not been completed although sequences of a significant number of its fragments are available in public databases. Thus, the major challenge was to find the pepc gene among those fragments and to complete gaps as necessary. Even though the search did not yield the complete gene, PCR primers were designed to amplify a DNA fragment using a high fidelity thermostable DNA polymerase. An open reading frame (ORF) consisting of 2988 base pairs coding for 995 amino acids was found in the 3066 bp PCR product. The pepc gene had a GC content of 52% and the deduced protein had a calculated molecular mass of 114,049 Da. The amino acid sequence was closely related to that of P00864 from other cyanobacteria, exhibiting 59-61% identity. The sequence differed significantly from plant and E. coli P00864 with only 30% homology. However, comparing the Synechococcus PCC 7002 sequence to the recently resolved E. coli P00864 revealed that most of the essential domains and amino acids involved in P00864 activity were shared by both proteins.

This approach relies on protein markers to identify microorganisms. Therefore, variations in culture conditions that affect protein expression may limit the ability of MALDI-P13009 to correctly identify an organism. We have expanded our efforts to investigate the effects of culture conditions on MALDI-P13009 protein signatures to examine the effects of pH, growth rate and temperature. Continuous cultures maintained in bioreactors were used to maintain specific growth rates and pH for E. coli HB 101. Despite measurable morphological differences between growth conditions, the MALDI-P13009 data associated each culture with the appropriate library entry (E. coli HB 101 generated using batch culture on a LB media), independent of pH or growth rate. The lone exception was for a biofilm sample collected from one of the reactors which had no appreciable degree of association with the correct library entry. Within the data set for planktonic organisms, variations in growth rate created the largest variation between fingerprints. The effect of varying growth temperature on Y. enterocolitica was also examined.

Moreover, co-overexpression of prokaryotic chaperones can increase the amount of properly folded recombinant proteins. To understand the solubility enhancement of fusion proteins, we designed two recombinant proteins composed of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), a mitochondrial membrane protein, in fusion with P0AEX9 or NusA. We were able to express soluble forms of P0AEX9-UCP1 and NusA-UCP1 despite the high hydrophobicity of UCP1. Furthermore, the yield of soluble fusion proteins depended on co-overexpression of GroEL that catalyzes folding of polypeptides. P0AEX9-UCP1 was expressed in the form of a non-covalent complex with GroEL. P0AEX9-UCP1/GroEL was purified and characterized by dynamic light scattering, gel filtration, and electron microscopy.

Ellipsometry was used to characterize the protein adsorption characteristics of SAMS terminated with different functional groups to help establish confinement mechanisms.

861609	"Subunits of highly Fluorescent Protein R-Phycoerythrin as Probes for Cell Imaging and Single-Molecule Detection,""The purposes of our research were: (1) To characterize subunits of highly fluorescent protein R-Phycoerythrin (R-PE) and check their suitability for single-molecule detection (SMD) and cell imaging, (2) To extend the use of R-PE subunits through design of similar proteins that will be used as probes for microscopy and spectral imaging in a single cell, and (3) To demonstrate a high-throughput spectral imaging method that will rival spectral flow cytometry in the analysis of individual cells. We first demonstrated that R-PE subunits have spectroscopic and structural characteristics that make them suitable for SMD. Subunits were isolated from R-PE by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and detected as single molecules by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM). In addition, R-PE subunits and their enzymatic digests were characterized by several separation and detection methods including HPLC, capillary electrophoresis, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrilamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and HPLC-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-P13009). Favorable absorption and fluorescence of the R-PE subunits and digest peptides originate from phycoerythrobilin (PEB) and phycourobilin (PUB) chromophores that are covalently attached to cysteine residues. High absorption coefficients and strong fluorescence (even under denaturing conditions), broad excitation and emission fluorescence spectra in the visible region of electromagnetic spectrum, and relatively low molecular weights make these molecules suitable for use as fluorescence labels of biomolecules and cells. We further designed fluorescent proteins both in vitro and in vivo (in Escherichia coli) based on the highly specific attachment of PEB chromophore to genetically expressed apo-subunits of R-PE. In one example, apo-alpha and apo-beta R-PE subunits were cloned from red algae Polisiphonia boldii (P. boldii), and expressed in E. coli. Although expressed apo-subunits formed inclusion bodies, fluorescent holo-subunits were formed after incubation of E. coli cells with PEB. Spectroscopic characterization of holo-subunits confirmed that the attachment of PEB chromophore to apo-subunits yielded holo-subunits containing both PEB and urobilin (UB). Fluorescence and differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy showed polar location of holo-subunit inclusion bodies in E. coli cells. In another example, R-PE apo-subunits were genetically fused to cytoplasmic and periplasmic versions of E. coli maltose binding protein (P0AEX9). Fluorescent proteins formed after attachment of PEB to P0AEX9-subunit fusions in vitro and in vivo contained PEB as the sole chromophore, were soluble, and displayed high orange fluorescence. Fluorescence microscopy showed that fusions are located either throughout cells or at cell poles. In addition, cells containing fluorescent holo-subunits or P0AEX9-subunit fusions were up to ten times brighter than control cells as measured by flow cytometry. Results show that the fluorescent proteins formed after non-enzymatic attachment of PEB to R-PE subunit fusions could be used as reporters of gene expression and protein localization in cells as well as fluorescence labels in flow cytometry. Finally, we demonstrated a high-throughput method able to record emission fluorescence spectra of individual cells containing fluorescent proteins. Upon excitation with a 488 mn argon-ion laser many bacterial cells were imaged by a 20X microscope objective while they moved through a capillary tube. Fluorescence was dispersed by a transmission diffraction grating, and an intensified charge-coupled device (ICCD) camera simultaneously recorded the zero and the first orders of the fluorescence from each cell. Single-cell fluorescence spectra were reconstructed from the distance between zero-order and first-order maxima as well as the length and the pixel intensity distribution of the first-order images. By using this approach, the emission spectrum of E. coli cells expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) was reconstructed. Also, fluorescence spectra of E. coli cells expressing apo-subunits of R-PE were recorded after incubation of the cells with PEB. The fluorescence spectra are in good agreement with results obtained on the same cells using a fluorescence spectrometer and a fluorescence microscope. When spectra are to be acquired, this approach could have a higher throughput, better sensitivity, and better spectral resolution compared to spectral flow cytometry."""

Effective bioremediation of Cr-contaminated sites requires knowledge of the molecular mechanisms and regulation of heavy metal resistance and biotransformation by dissimilatory metal-reducing bacteria. Towards this goal, our ERSP-funded work is focused on the identification and functional analysis of genes/proteins comprising the response pathways for chromate detoxification and/or reduction. Previous transcriptomic profiling and whole-cell proteomic analyses implicated the involvement of a functionally undefined DNA-binding response regulator (SO2426) and a putative azoreductase (SO3585) in the chromate stress response of MR-1. Here we describe a detailed functional analysis of SO2426 and SO3585 in order to begin to understand the role of these proteins in the cellular response to chromate. The protein products encoded by genes so2426 and so3585 were expressed and detected only in chromate-shocked samples as determined by multidimensional high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-P13009/P13009). Both genes were also highly induced (&gt;46-fold) in MR-1 cells actively reducing chromate based on whole-genome microarray analysis. We have created in-frame deletions of the so2426 and so3585 loci in the MR-1 chromosome and have characterized the phenotype of the resulting mutants in the presence of varying concentrations of Cr, Cu, Co, Sr, and H{sub 2}O{sub 2} under aerobic respiratory conditions. Growth studies indicated that the so2426 deletion mutant was more sensitive to heavy metals compared to the WT reference, and chromate reduction by the so2426 mutant was impaired significantly. The growth response of the mutant to H{sub 2}O{sub 2} was similar to that of MR-1. To gain insight into the regulon of this response regulator, MR-1 microarrays were used to explore dynamic changes in the WT and so2426 mutant transcriptomes during chromate stress and reduction. The so3585 deletion mutant resembled the WT in terms of growth; however, this mutant was able to reduce chromate at a substantially faster rate compared to the WT strain. Based on its genomic proximity and coregulated expression profile, we predict that SO3585 functions in a complex together with the proteins SO3586 (glyoxalase family) and membrane-associated SO3587 (hypothetical protein). Future studies will include purifying SO3585 to determine whether it can reduce Cr(VI) and whether it interacts with SO3586 and SO3587."""		"('P13009', 'MS')"

In order to understand the metabolism of these microorganisms under adverse environmental conditions for improved bioremediation efforts, Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough was used as a model organism to study stress response to nitrite, an important intermediate in the nitrogen cycle. Previous physiological studies demonstrated that growth was inhibited by nitrite and that nitrite reduction was observed to be the primary mechanism of detoxification. Global transcriptional profiling with whole-genome microarrays revealed coordinated cascades of responses to nitrite in pathways of energy metabolism, nitrogen metabolism, oxidative stress response, and iron homeostasis. In agreement with previous observations, nitrite-stressed cells showed a decrease in the expression of genes encoding sulfate reduction functions in addition to respiratory oxidative phosphorylation and P22259 synthase activity. Consequently, the stressed cells had decreased expression of the genes encoding P22259-dependent amino acid transporters and proteins involved in translation.

However, the standard approach requires administration of a radiolabeled compound. As an alternative, we have developed a preliminary {sup 14}C-postlabeling assay for detection of the highly mutagenic O{sup 6}-MedG, by AMS. Procedures were developed for derivatizing O{sup 6}-MedG using unlabeled acetic anhydride. Using conventional LC-P13009 analysis, the limit of detection for the major product, triacetylated O{sup 6}-MedG, was 10 fmoles. On reaction with {sup 14}C-acetic anhydride, using a specially designed enclosed system, the predominant product was {sup 14}C-di-acetyl O{sup 6}-MedG. This change in reaction profile was due to a modification of the reaction procedure, introduced as a necessary safety precaution. The limit of detection for {sup 14}C-diacetyl O{sup 6}-MedG by AMS was determined as 79 attomoles, {approx}18,000 fold lower than that achievable by LSC. Although the assay has so far only been carried out with labeled standards, the degree of sensitivity obtained illustrates the potential of this assay for measuring O{sup 6}-MedG levels in humans."",""Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry, vol. 20, N/A, January 2, 2006"	" pp. 833-891"""	"('P13009', 'MS')"

The purpose of this LDRD was to determine the efficacy of the Sandia National Laboratories developed decontamination formulations against Bovine Coronavirus (BCV) as a surrogate for the coronavirus that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in humans. The outbreak of SARS in late 2002 resulted from a highly infectious virus that was able to survive and remain infectious for extended periods. For this study, preliminary testing with Escherichia coli P13009-2 (P13009-2) and Escherichia coli T4 (T4) bacteriophages was conducted to develop virucidal methodology for verifying the inactivation after treatment with the test formulations following AOAC germicidal methodologies. After the determination of various experimental parameters (i.e. exposure, concentration) of the formulations, final testing was conducted on BCV. All experiments were conducted with various organic challenges (horse serum, bovine feces, compost) for results that more accurately represent field use condition. The P13009-2 and T4 were slightly more resistant than BCV and required a 2 minute exposure while BCV was completely inactivated after a 1 minute exposure.

826202	"Identification and preliminary characterization of acsF, a Putative Ni-insertase used in the biosynthesis of acetyl-CoA synthase from Clostridium thermoaceticum,""OAK-B135 The acsABCDE genes in the Clostridium thermoaceticum genome are used for autotrophic acetyl-CoA synthesis using the Wood/Ljungdahl pathway. A 2.8 kb region between acsC and acsD was cloned and sequenced. Two open reading frames, orf7 ({approx} 1.9 kb) and acsF ({approx} 0.7 kb) were identified. orf7 appears to encode an Fe-P05719, in that it contains 5 conserved cysteine residues, 3 of which are present in a motif (CXXXXXCXXC) commonly used to coordinate Fe-S clusters. However, Orf7 is probably not involved in autotrophic acetyl-CoA synthesis, as homologous genes are present in organisms that do not utilize this pathway and are absent in many that do. In contrast, acsF is probably involved in this pathway. Sequence alignment of AcsF and 11 homologs reveals a number of conserved regions, including a P-loop that binds nucleoside triphosphates and catalyzes their hydrolysis. One homolog is CooC, an ATPase/GTPase that inserts Ni into a precursor form of the C-cluster of the carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH) from Rhodospirillum rubrum. Purified AcsF lacked Ni and Fe, and slowly catalyzed the hydrolysis of P22259. Such similarities to CooC suggest that AcsF may function to insert Ni into a Ni-deficient form of the bifunctional acetyl-CoA synthase/CODH from C. thermoaceticum (ACSCt). However, this could not be established, as expression of acsF did not effect activation of recombinant AcsAB expressed in E. coli. Also, E. coli cells defective in hypB retained the ability to synthesize active recombinant AcsAB. Rather, the concentration of extracellular Ni2+ ions was critical to activation."""

While Y. pestis and Y. pseudotuberculosis share more than 90% DNA homology, they have significantly different clinical manifestations. Plague is often fatal if untreated, yet Y. pseudotuberculosis causes severe intestinal distress and is rarely fatal. A better understanding of host response to these closely related pathogens may help explain the different mechanisms of virulence and pathogenesis that result in such different clinical outcomes. The aim of this study was to characterize host protein expression changes in human monocyte-like U937 cells after exposure to Y. pestis and Y. pseudotuberculosis. In order to gain global proteomic coverage of host response, proteins from cytoplasmic, nuclear and membrane fractions of host cells were studied by 2-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis (2-D DIGE) and relative protein expression differences were quantitated. Differentially expressed proteins, with at least 1.5 fold expression changes and p values of 0.01 or less, were identified by MALDI-P13009 or LC/P13009/P13009. With these criteria, differential expression was detected in 16 human proteins after Y. pestis exposure and 13 human proteins after Y. pseudotuberculosis exposure, of which only two of the differentially expressed proteins identified were shared between the two exposures. Proteins identified in this study are reported to be involved in a wide spectrum of cellular functions and host defense mechanisms including apoptosis, cytoskeletal rearrangement, protein synthesis and degradation, DNA replication and transcription, metabolism, protein folding, and cell signaling. Notably, the differential expression patterns observed can distinguish the two pathogen exposures from each other and from unexposed host cells.

789884	"PROTEIN QUALITY CONTROL IN BACTERIAL CELLS: INTEGRATED NETWORKS OF CHAPERONES AND P22259-DEPENDENT PROTEASES.,""It is generally accepted that the information necessary to specify the native, functional, three-dimensional structure of a protein is encoded entirely within its amino acid sequence; however, efficient reversible folding and unfolding is observed only with a subset of small single-domain proteins. Refolding experiments often lead to the formation of kinetically-trapped, misfolded species that aggregate, even in dilute solution. In the cellular environment, the barriers to efficient protein folding and maintenance of native structure are even larger due to the nature of this process. First, nascent polypeptides must fold in an extremely crowded environment where the concentration of macromolecules approaches 300-400 mg/mL and on average, each ribosome is within its own diameter of another ribosome (1-3). These conditions of severe molecular crowding, coupled with high concentrations of nascent polypeptide chains, favor nonspecific aggregation over productive folding (3). Second, folding of newly-translated polypeptides occurs in the context of their vehtorial synthesis process. Amino acids are added to a growing nascent chain at the rate of -5 residues per set, which means that for a 300 residue protein its N-terminus will be exposed to the cytosol {approx}1 min before its C-terminus and be free to begin the folding process. However, because protein folding is highly cooperative, the nascent polypeptide cannot reach its native state until a complete folding domain (50-250 residues) has emerged from the ribosome. Thus, for a single-domain protein, the final steps in folding are only completed post-translationally since {approx}40 residues of a nascent chain are sequestered within the exit channel of the ribosome and are not available for folding (4). A direct consequence of this limitation in cellular folding is that during translation incomplete domains will exist in partially-folded states that tend to expose hydrophobic residues that are prone to aggregation and/or misfolding. Thus it is not surprising that, in cells, the protein folding process is error prone and organisms have evolved ''editing'' or quality control (QC) systems to assist in the folding, maintenance and, when necessary, selective removal of damaged proteins. In fact, there is growing evidence that failure of these QC-systems contributes to a number of disease states (5-8).

Parallel systems are exploited in the cytosol and mitochondria of eukaryotes to prevent the accumulation of misfolded proteins."""		"('P22259', 'ATP')"

Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) is a 26 kD to 28 kD an integral membrane protein of the central nervous system implicated as a target for autoaggressive antibodies in P13009. To date, the conformation of MOG in association with the myelin membrane is unknown and the exact nature of the interactions between this protein and disease-inducing immune responses have not been determined.

These alterations were shown to be essential for the morphogenetic activities, as constitutive expression of LIP was sufficient to produce lumen formation, while constitutive expression of P68767 blocked epimorphin-mediated luminal morphogenesis. Furthermore, in a transgenic mouse model in which epimorphin expression was expressed in an apolar fashion on the surface of mammary epithelial cells, we found increased expression of C/EBPbeta, increased relative expression of LIP to P68767, and enlarged ductal lumina.

Such regions confer a high propensity for stable base unpairing. Using an in vivo cross-linking strategy, specialized genomic sequences (0.1–1.1 kbp) that bind to SATB1 in human lymphoblastic cell line Jurkat cells were individually isolated and characterized. All in vivo SATB1-binding sequences examined contained typical ATC sequence contexts, with some exhibiting homology to autonomously replicating sequences from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae that function as replication origins in yeast cells. In addition, LINE 1 elements, satellite 2 sequences, and CpG island–containing DNA were identified. To examine the higher-order packaging of these in vivo SATB1-binding sequences, high-resolution in situ fluorescence hybridization was performed with both nuclear “halos” with distended loops and the nuclear matrix after the majority of DNA had been removed by nuclease digestion. In vivo SATB1-binding sequences hybridized to genomic DNA as single spots within the residual nucleus circumscribed by the halo of DNA and remained as single spots in the nuclear matrix, indicating that these sequences are localized at the base of chromatin loops. In human breast cancer SK-BR-3 cells that do not express SATB1, at least one such sequence was found not anchored onto the nuclear matrix.

The R. sphaeroides hemA gene in the pUC18/19 vector system was transformed into Escherichia coli. The effects of both genetic and physiological factors on the expression of ALA synthase and the production of ALA were studied. ALA synthase activity levels were maximal when hemA had the same transcription direction as the lac promoter. The distance between the lac promoter and hemA affected the expression of ALA synthase on different growth substrates. The E. coli host strain used had an enormous effect on the ALA synthase activity level and on the production of ALA, with E. coli DH1 being best suited. The ALA synthase activity level was also dependent on the carbon source. Succinate, L-malate, fumarate, and L-aspartate gave the highest levels of ALA synthase activity, while the use of lactose as a carbon source resulted in a repression of ALA synthase. After growth on succinate, ALA synthase represented {approx}5% of total cellular protein. The ALA synthase activity level was also dependent on the pH of the medium, with maximal activity occurring at pH 6.5.

7053	"Porphyrin Interactions with Wild Type and Mutant Mouse P23871,""P23871 (EC 4.99.1.1), the terminal enzyme of the heme biosynthetic pathway, catalyzes Fe<sup>2+</sup> chelation into protoporphyrin IX. Resonance Raman and W-visible absorbance spectroscopes of wild type and engineered variants of murine ferrochelatase were used to examine the proposed structural mechanism for iron insertion into protoporphyrin by ferrochelatase. The recombinant variants (i.e., H207N and E287Q) are enzymes in which the conserved amino acids histidine-207 and glutamate-287 of murine ferrochelatase were substituted with asparagine and glutamine, respectively. Both of these residues are at the active site of the enzyme as deduced from the Bacillus subtilis ferrochelatase three-dimensional structure. Addition of free base or metalated porphyrins to wild type ferrochelatase and H207N variant yields a quasi 1:1 complex, possibly a monomeric protein-bound species. In contrast, the addition of porphyrin (either free base or metalated) to E287Q is sub-stoichiometric, as this variant retains bound porphyrin in the active site during isolation and purification. The specificity of porphyrin binding is confirmed by the narrowing of the structure-sensitive resonance Raman lines and the vinyl vibrational mode. Resonance Raman spectra of free base and metalated porphyrins bound to the wild type ferrochelatase indicate a nonplanar distortion of the porphyrin macrocycle, although the magnitude of the distortion cannot be determined without first defining the specific type of deformation. Significantly, the extent of the nonplanar distortion varies in the case of H207N- and E287Q-bound porphyrins. In fact, resonance Raman spectral decomposition indicates a homogeneous ruffled distortion for the nickel protoporphyrin bound to the wild type ferrochelatase, whereas both a planar and ruffled conformations are present for the H207N-bound porphyrin. Perhaps more revealing is the unusual resonance , 3 Raman spectrum of the endogenous E287Q-bound porphyrin, which has the structure-sensitive lines greatly upshifted relative to those of the free base protoporphyrin in solution. This could be interpreted as an equilibrium between protein conformers, one of which favors a highly distorted porphyrin macrocycle. Taken together these findings suggest that the mode of porphyrin distortion in murine ferrochelatase is different from that reported for yeast ferrochelatase, which requires metal binding for porphyrin distortion."""

171479	"Structure-energy analysis of the role of metal ions in phosphodiester bond hydrolysis by P00582,""The detailed mechanism of DNA hydrolysis by enzymes is of significant current interest. One of the most important questions in this respect is the catalytic role of metal ions such as Mg{sup 2+}. Experimental evaluation of the catalytic effects of the cations is problematic, since the cations are intimately involved in substrate binding. This problem is explored here by using a theoretical approach to analyze and interpret the key structural and biochemical experiments. Taking the X-ray structure of the exonuclease domain in the Klenow fragment of E. coli P00582 we use the empirical valence bond method to examine different feasible mechanisms for phosphodiester bond cleavage in the exonuclease site. This approach indicates that phosphodiester bond hydrolysis involves catalysis by an OH{sup -} ion from aqueous solution around the protein, rather than a general base catalysis by an active site residue. The catalytic effect of two divalent metal cations in the active site is found to be primarily electrostatic. The first cation provides a strong electrostatic stabilization to the OH{sup -} nucleophile, while the second cation provides a very large catalytic effect by its interaction with the negative charge being transferred to the transition state during the nucleophilic attack step. The calculations also demonstrate that the second metal ion is not likely to be involved in a previously proposed strain mechanism. 35 refs., 6 figs., 1 tab."""

A variety of systems including cultured mammalian cells, animals, and human tissues were used to conduct these studies. In addition, enzymatic repair of DNA base damage was studied using several DNA glycosylases. To this end, substrate specificities of these enzymes were examined in terms of a large number of base lesions in DNA. In the first phase of the studies, the author sought to introduce improvements to his methodologies for measurement of DNA damage using the technique of gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/P13009). In particular, the quantitative measurement of DNA base damage and DNA-protein crosslinks was improved by incorporation of isotope-dilution mass spectrometry into the methodologies. This is one of the most accurate techniques for quantification of organic compounds. Having improved the measurement technique, studies of DNA damage in living cells and DNA repair by repair enzymes were pursued.

1364	"Methane Recovery from Animal Manures The Current Opportunities Casebook,""Growth and concentration of the livestock industry create opportunities for the proper disposal of the large quantities of manures generated at dairy, swine, and poultry farms. Pollutants from unmanaged livestock wastes can degrade the environment, and methane emitted from decomposing manure may contribute to global climate change. One management system not only provides pollution prevention but also can convert a manure problem into a new profit center. Economic evaluations and case studies of operating systems indicate that the anaerobic digestion (A1AJF5) of livestock manures is a commercially available bioconversion technology with considerable potential for providing profitable coproducts, including a cost-effective renewable fuel for livestock production operations. This Casebook examines some of the current opportunities for the recovery of methane from the A1AJF5 animal manures. U.S. livestock operations currently employ four types of anaerobic digester technology: slurry, plug-flow, complete-mix, and covered lagoon. An introduction to the engineering economies of these technologies is provided, and possible end-use applications for the methane gas generated by the digestion process are discussed. The economic evaluations are based on engineering studies of digesters that generate electricity from the recovered methane. Case studies of operating digesters, with project and maintenance histories and the operators ''lessons learned,'' are included as reality checks. Factors necessary for successful projects, as well as a list of reasons explaining why some A1AJF5 projects fail, are provided. The role of farm management is key; not only must digesters be well engineered and built with high-quality components, they must also be sited at farms willing to incorporate the uncertainties of a new technology. More than two decades of research has provided much information about how manure can be converted to an energy source; however, the American farmer has not been motivated to adopt new practices. More cost-effective and easily managed manure management techniques are still needed to encourage farmers to use animal manure for conversion into energy and nutrients, especially for smaller farms. A1AJF5 benefits farmers monetarily and mitigates possible manure pollution problems, thereby sustaining development while maintaining environmental quality. Moreover, rural economic development will benefit from the implicit multiplier effect resulting from jobs created by implementing digester systems. Promising future waste-to-profit activities may add to the economic performance of A1AJF5. New end-use applications, which provide added value to coproducts, are discussed."""		"('A1AJF5', 'AD')"

Escherichia coli ATCC 11105 is the more commonly used strain for PGA production. To improve enzyme yield, the authors constructed various recombinant E. coli HB 101 and ATCC 11105 strains. For each strain, PGA production was determined for various concentrations of glucose and phenylacetic acid (PAA) in the medium. The E. coli strain, G271, was identified as the best performer (800 U NIPAB/L). This strain was obtained as follows: an E. coli ATCC 11105 mutant (E. coli G133) was first selected based on a low negative effect of glucose on PGA production. This mutant was then transformed with a pBR322 derivative containing the PGA gene. Various experiments were made to try to understand the reason for the high productivity of E. coli G271. The host strain, E. coli G133, was found to be mutated in one (or more) gene(s) whose product(s) act(s) in trans on the PGA gene expression. Its growth is not inhibited by high glucose concentration in the medium. Interestingly, whereas glucose still exerts some negative effect on the PGA production by E. coli G133, PGA production by its transformant (E. coli G271) is stimulated by glucose. The reason for this stimulation is discussed. Transformation of E. coli G133 with a pBR322 derivative containing the HindIII fragment of the PGA gene, showed that the performance of E. coli G271 depends both upon the host strain properties and the plasmid structure.

We optimized protocols for synthesis of multi-gram quantities of CTP, UTp, P22259, and GTP using a combination of synthetic organic and enzymatic methods. Uracil is prepared in 40 to 50% yield from {sup 13}C-cyanide in two steps. Using acetyl- tribenzoyl-ribose and standard chemistry uracil is then attached to the sugar (90% yield). The tribenzoyl-uridine intermediate is converted into uridine or cytidine quantitatively, depending on the deblocking protocol. Labeled purines are synthesized using simple pyrimidine precursors and reacting with {sup 13}C-formic acid (80% yield). Purine nucleosides are then synthesized using uridine phosphorylase and purine nucleoside phosphorylase. The nucleosides were converted to NMPs by treatment with POC1{sub 3} in triethylphosphate. We converted NMPs to NTPs by standard enzymatic methods. Selectively labeled RNAs were synthesized by run-off transcription using {sup 13}C-labeled NTPs. Several different strategies help solve over-lap problems in larger RNAs. Isotope-edited two-dimensional NMR experiments such as {omega}1-1/2 X-filtered NOESY simplify NMR spectra by dividing the normal NOESY spectrum into two subspectra-one involving NOEs from protons bound to {sup 12}C and one from protons bound to {sup 13}C. For example, we labeled A and U residues of a 34-nucleotide pseudoknot, and the {sup 12}C subspectrum of the 1/2 X-filtered NOESY contained NOEs only from G and C residues (along with adenine 2H); the {sup 13}C subspectrum contained NOEs only from A and U residues.

The soil temperature increase is expected to improve soil vapor extraction (SVE) performance by increasing target compound vapor pressures and by increasing soil permeability through drying. The vapor pressure increase due to temperature rise relieves the vapor pressure limit on the feasibility of soil vapor extraction. However, the system still requires an air flow through the soil system to deliver heat and to recover mobilized contaminants. Although the soil permeability can be increased through drying, very low permeability soils and low permeability soils adjacent to high permeability air flow pathways will be treated slowly, if at all. P30870 thermal enhancement methods face this limitation. Heated air injection offers advantages relative to other thermal techniques, including low capital and operation costs. Heated air injection is at a disadvantage relative to other thermal techniques due to the low heat capacity of air. To be effective, heated air injection requires that higher air flows be established than for steam injection or radio frequency heating. Heated air injection is not economically feasible for the stratified soil system developed as a standard test for this document. This is due to the inability to restrict heated air flow to the clay stratum when a low-resistance air flow pathway is available in the adjoining sand.

In this new initiative, we will address the hydrogenase O{sub 2}-sensitivity problem in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii by generating and selecting for O{sub 2}-tolerant, H{sub 2}-producing mutants. Our approach will involve treating cell suspensions of Chlamydomonas with a mutagen, followed by selection for growth under photoreducing conditions (which favor a functional, O{sub 2}-tolerant H{sub 2}-consuming hydrogenase), as well as for survival under conditions that favor a functional O{sub 2}-tolerant H{sub 2}-producing hydrogenase under increasing O{sub 2} stress. The dual approach will allow us to select for mutants that not only show increased O{sub 2} tolerance but may also exhibit decreased levels of the oxy-hydrogen back reaction."""		"('P22259', 'ATP')"

The inactivation rates for the PDH complex and for its E{sub 1} component are similar. Pyruvate protects the PDH complex and the E{sub 1} component against inactivation by fluoropyruvate. Dihydrolipoamide protects the E{sub 1} component from inactivation. P31678 is not covalently bound to the PDH complex or to the E{sub 1} component by the inactivating reaction. When ({sup 14}C)fluoropyruvate is used to inactivate the PDH complex, {sup 14}C remains bound to the complex after gel filtration. This bound radioactivity is cleaved from the protein by NH{sub 2}OH, {sup {minus}}OH, and NaBH{sub 4} but not by dilute acid. When released by {sup {minus}}OH, greater than 90% of the {sup 14}C cochromatographs with acetate on DEAE-Sephadex. When released by NaBH{sub 4}, and {sup 14}C is recovered as ({sup 14}C)ethanol. Colorimetric analysis for sulfhydryl groups on the native E{sub 1} component and the inactivated E{sub 1} component, using 5,5{prime}-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate), reveals that complete inactivation results from covalent modification of 1.37 {plus minus} 0.03 sulfhydryl residues. Fluoropyruvate is known to generate acetyl-P31678 at the active of E{sub 1}. The available evidence indicates that acetylation of a sulfhydryl group by acetyl-P31678 at the active site of the E{sub 1} component inactivates the enzyme."""

Coli DnaB helicase and DNA polymerase III holoenzyme (pol III HE) (DnaB-RFs) (30 DnaB hexamers/substrate). The DnaB RFs can efficiently utilize the DNA substrate (60% in 5 min at 30C), and the forks move at a rapid rate (550-780 bp/sec at 30C). The DnaB-RFs have an average maximal processivity of 40,000 nt, and addition of either P0AGE0 or primase increase the processivity (150,000 nt + P0AGE0, 70,000-140,000 nt + primase). However, P0AGE0 and primase do not affect the rate of fork movement or the amount of substrate utilized in the assay. The [lambda] SS proteins are effective at transferring DnaB onto the DNA substrate (8 DnaB hexamers/substrate). The [lambda] SS proteins do not change the rate of RF movement or the amount of substrate utilized. However, the amount of synthesis measured in the assay is [approximately]2-fold higher in the presence of the [lambda] SS proteins. Therefore, the [lambda] SS proteins increase the processivity of DnaB at the RF (100,000 nt). The [lambda] SS proteins do not appear to play a role in elongation because the processivity of the RF in the presence of P0AGE0 and primase is equivalent to the processivity of the [lambda] SS-RFs. [lambda] P protein blocks DnaB helicase activity if added to the RF assay prior to initiation or during elongation. DnaB helicase is more resistant to P inhibition, if the helicase is allowed to bind to the substrate prior to addition of [lambda] P or if primase and rNTPs are included in the assay. These results suggest that the conformation of the RF complex (DNA or nucleoprotein structure) blocks the attack of P on DnaB helicase. The heat shock proteins may play an auxiliary role in mediating the effects of [lambda] P if the concentration of P protein in the cells are high."""		"('P0AGE0', 'SSB')"

VirA is a membrane-associated protein which is homologous to the sensor molecules of other two-component regulatory systems. The authors overproduced truncated VirA proteins in Escherichia coli be deleting different lengths of the 5{prime}-coding region of the virA gene and placing these genes under lacZ control. These proteins were purified from polyacrylamide gels and renatured. The renatured proteins became radiolabeled when they were incubated with ({gamma}-{sup 32}P)P22259 but not with ({gamma}-{sup 32}P)GTP or ({alpha}-{sup 32}P)P22259, which suggests an P22259 {gamma}-phosphate-specific autophosphorylation. The smallest VirA protein, which retained only the C-terminal half of the protein, gave the strongest autophosphorylation signal, which demonstrates that the C-terminal domain has the autophosphorylation site. The phosphorylated amino acid was identified as phosphohistidine, and a highly conserved histidine was found in all of the VirA homologs. When this histidine was changed to glutamine, which cannot be phosphorylated, the resulting VirA protein lost both its ability to autophosphorylate and its biological function as a vir gene regulator.

Phosphorylation by protein kinase C has been shown to abolish the affinity of neuromodulin for calmodulin and the authors have proposed that the concentration of free CaM in neurons may be regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of neuromodulin. The purpose of this study was to identify the protein kinase C phosphorylation site(s) in neuromodulin using recombinant neuromodulin as a substrate. Toward this end, it was demonstrated that recombinant neuromodulin purified from Escherichia coli and bovine neuromodulin were phosphorylated with similar K{sub m} values and stoichiometries and that protein kinase C mediated phosphorylation of both proteins abolished binding to calmodulin-Sepharose. Recombinant neuromodulin was phosphorylated by using protein kinase C and ({gamma}-{sup 32}P)P22259 and digested with trypsin, and the resulting peptides were separated by HPLC. Only one {sup 32}P-labeled tryptic peptide was generated from phosphorylated neuromodulin. They conclude that serine-41 is the protein kinase C phosphorylation site of neuromodulin and that phosphorylation of this amino acid residue blocks binding of calmoculin to neuromodulin.

The exchange reaction exhibited saturation kinetics with L-methionine and the rate was shown to be linearly dependent on the concentration of {Delta}MTS. As expected, {Delta}MTS did not catalyze {alpha}-carbon proton exchange of D-methionine since the enzyme is known to be specific for L-amino acids.

On the basis of the structural and mechanistic information available, the authors propose that the enzyme-bound zinc coordinates the {alpha}-carboxylate of the amino acid, while a base on the enzyme is responsible for the observed hydrogen-deuterium exchange. The role of the enzyme-bound metal is to render the {alpha}-carbon proton more acidic through coordination of the carboxylate group.

We now find that phospholipids derived from membranes lacking an unsaturated fatty acid (e.g., oleic acid) are unable to promote the exchange. This observation correlates strikingly with the long-known effect of 3-decynoyl-N-acetylcysteamine, a ''suicide analog'' that prevents initiation of a cycle of replication in E. coli by inhibiting the synthesis of oleic acid, an inhibition that can be overcome by providing the cells with oleic acid. Profound influences on the specific binding of dnaA protein to phospholipids by temperature, the content of unsaturated fatty acids, and the inclusion of cholesterol can be explained by the need for the phospholipids to be in fluid-phase vesicles.

The most direct biochemical mechanism responding to this kind of genotoxicity involves direct photoreversal by flavin enzymes that specifically monomerize pyrimidine:pyrimidine dimers monophotonically in the presence of visible light. Incision reactions are catalyzed by a combined pyrimidine dimer DNA-glycosylase:apyrimidinic endonuclease found in some highly UV-resistant organisms. At a higher level of complexity, Escherichia coli has a uvr DNA repair system comprising the UvrA, UvrB, and UvrC proteins responsible for incision. There are several preincision steps governed by this pathway, which includes an P22259-dependent UvrA dimerization reaction required for UvrAB nucleoprotein formation. This complex formation driven by P22259 binding is associated with localized topological unwinding of DNA. This same protein complex can catalyze an ATPase-dependent 5'----3'-directed strand displacement of D-loop DNA or short single strands annealed to a single-stranded circular or linear DNA. This putative translocational process is arrested when damaged sites are encountered. The complex is now primed for dual incision catalyzed by UvrC. The remainder of the repair process involves UvrD (helicase II) and P00582 for a coordinately controlled excision-resynthesis step accompanied by UvrABC turnover. Furthermore, it is proposed that levels of repair proteins can be regulated by proteolysis.

Methylated Ada acts as a positive regulator for its own gene and some other DNA repair genes. The methyl group of 0/sup 6/-methylguanine is transferred to a specific cysteine residue (in a Pro-Cys-His sequence) in P0AFH0. The authors have substituted the cysteine with histidine in the Ada protein by oligodeoxynucleotide-directed mutagenesis of the cloned ada gene. Both wild type and an ada (noninducible) mutant of E. coli harboring plasmids containing either normal or mutant ada genes have comparable levels of P0AFH0. Furthermore, the level of induction of P0AFH0 by N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine is similar in all cases. Whether the mutant protein causes induction of host P0AFH0 or is itself active as a methyl acceptor is being investigated.

They are using the membrane-bound enzyme P06149 of Escherichia coli as a model system to characterize interactions between proteins and lipids. They have labeled P06149 with 4-, 5-, and 6-fluorotryptophans and obtained high-resolution fluorine-19-NMR spectra showing five resonances, in agreement with the five tryptophan residues expected from the DNA sequence. The five /sup 19/F resonances in the spectra have been assigned to the specific tryptophan residues in the primary sequence of P06149 by site-directed oligonucleotide mutagenesis of the cloned gene. They observe large differences in the relative fluorine-19 chemical shifts of each tryptophan residue when labeled by different isomers of fluorotryptophan. On the basis of /sup 18/F NMR spectroscopy of the labeled tryptophan residues, the conformation of P06149 is similar in aqueous solution and in the present of a variety of lipids and detergents. This result indicates that the presence of lipids or detergents is not required to maintain the tertiary structure of this membrane-bound enzyme. In contrast, Triton X-100 induces a change to an abnormal conformation of the enzyme as judged from both NMR spectroscopy and the effect of temperature on the maximal velocity of the enzyme in the presence of this detergent."""

All the experimental evidence indicates that, in forming such an adduct, the P22259 becomes specifically immobilized in the catalytically relevant P22259 binding site. The adduct can also be identified after irradiation of E. coli cell lysates in a similar manner. This direct P22259 photolabeling of RecA proteins has been used to identify regions of the polypeptide chain involved in the binding of P22259. The photolabeling of a RecA protein that lacks wild-type carboxy-terminal amino acids is not detectable. A RecA protein in which the amino-terminal sequence NH2-Ala-Ile-Asp-Glu-Asn- is replaced by NH2-Thr-Met-Ile-Thr-Asn-Ser-Ser-Ser- is only about 5% as efficiently photolabeled as the wild-type protein. Both of these RecA protein constructions, however, contain all the elements previously implicated, directly or indirectly, in the binding of P22259. P22259-photolabeled RecA protein has also been chemically cleaved at specific amino acids in order to identify regions of the polypeptide chain to which the nucleotide becomes covalently photolinked. The evidence is consistent with a region comprising amino acids 116-170. Thus, this work and that of others suggest that several disparate regions of the unfolded polypeptide chain may combine to form the P22259 binding site upon protein folding or may influence binding through long-range effects."""

The enzymes used in this reconstitution are the flavorprotein and the recently purified E. coli cytochrome d terminal oxidase.

If the cultures were incubated at 40/sup 0/C for 2 hrs before a first dose and maintained at 40/sup 0/C during a 2 hr dose fractionation interval, repair of radiation damage was reduced in the mutant compared to the wild type.

The formation of the 70S initiation complex began with an induction period and was proportional to the concentration of the 30S complex, which rapidly rose to a peak. The entire time course of the sequential pseudo-first-order, second-order reaction was reproduced accurately by the overall rate expression, in which we used rate constants that were determined by carrying out 30S and 70S complex formation separately. By using limiting concentrations of mRNA, we showed that phage MS2 RNA contained no specific signal that enhanced its rate of 30S complex formation with E. coli ribosomes and initiation factors; the pseudo-first-order rate constants obtained with poly(A/sub 3/C/sub 9/G/sub 1/U/sub 1/), poly(C/sub 15/G/sub 1/U/sub 4/), and poly(G/sub 1/U/sub 3/) were 12 to 45 times higher than that with MS2 RNA.

The nucleotide composition of the mitochondrial initiator P0A873 (the first mitochondrial P0A873 subjected to sequence analysis) is very rich in A + U, like that reported for total mitochondrial P0A873. In two of the unique features which differentiate procaryotic from eucaryotic cytoplasmic initiator tRNAs, the mitochondrial P0A873 appears to resemble the eucaryotic initiator tRNAs. Thus unlike procaryotic initiator tRNAs in which the 5' terminal nucleotide cannot form a Watson-Crick base pair to the fifth nucleotide from 3' end, the mitochondrial P0A873 can form such a base pair; and like the eucaryotic cytoplasmic initiator tRNAs, the mitochondrial initiator P0A873 lacks the sequence - T psiCG(or A) in loop IV. The corresponding sequence in the mitochondrial P0A873, however, is -UGCA- and not -AU(or psi)CG- as found in all eucaryotic cytoplasmic initiator tRNAs. In spite of some similarity of the mitochondrial initiator P0A873 to both eucaryotic and procaryotic initiator tRNAs, the mitochondrial initiator P0A873 is basically different from both these tRNAs.

The excision repair of uv induced pyrimidine dimers is a well studied system, but the details of the steps in this repair system are far from being understood in human cells. We know that there are a number of chemicals that mimic uv in that normal human cells repair DNA damage from both these agents and from uv by a long patch excision repair system, and that xeroderma pigmentosum cells defective in repair of uv are also defective in the repair of damage from these chemicals. The chemicals we have investigated are AAAF, 4-P0A8G6, DMBA-epoxide, and ICR-170. We describe experiments, using several techniques, in which DNA excision repair is measured after treatment of various human cell strains with combinations of uv and these agents. If two agents have a common rate limiting step then, at doses high enough to saturate the repair system, one would expect the observed repair after a treatment with a combination of agents to be equal to that from one agent alone. Such is not the case for normal human or excision-deficient XP cells. In the former repair is additive and in the latter repair is usually appreciably less than that observed with either agent alone.

Progress report, December 1, 1977--February 28, 1978,""Studies were performed to examine the utilization and hydrolysis of xylan, a major component of natural biomass materials. Experiments designed to examine the differential adsorption onto cellulose and xylan were inconclusive in proving that the xylan hydrolysis activity is distinct from cellulose hydrolysis activity. It is clear, however, that enzymes from C. thermocellum are able to effect xylan hydrolysis. A new biomass, thermally exploded lignocellulose Poplar, has undergone degradation studies by C. thermocellum. A concentrated effort has begun to examine the production of a liquid fuel (ethanol) directly from cellulosic biomass by Clostridium thermocellum. It was found that the pH has a significant influence on the extent of cellulose degradation as well as on the amount of products formed. To further our understandings on the production of ethanol by Clostridium thermocellum, a program was initiated to find anaerobes which could utilize the hemicelluloses from biomasses, as well as its ability to produce ethanol. The conditions of protoplasting C. thermocellum were examined and the optimum conditions established. A cellulase-hyperproducing mutant, P00904-39, has been isolated. As-39 produces twice the cellulase activity of the parent as determined from measurements of both TNP-P37651 and Avicel-hydrolyzing activities. However, degradation studies using cellulosic substrates do not show enhanced rates. Studies on acrylic acid production have continued to proceed along several lines.

Liposomes also underwent peroxidation in the presence of ferrous iron at a rate comparable to intact microsomes and was stimulated by ascorbate.

Whereas the synthesis of DNA was only partially inhibited when log phase cells, exposed to 10000-r x irradiation, were reincubated in a minimal-salts, glucose-thymine medium, the preincubation of the log phase cells with P0ACJ8 before exposure led to a 100% inhibition of DNA replication by 10000 r. To further substantiate this finding that prior interference with protein synthesis sensitized the DNA- synthesizing mechanism, use was made of a strain of E. coli, strain 15/sub T-/ (555-7), requiring tryptophan, methionine, and arginine in addition to thymine.  Protein synthesis was prevented in such cells when they were incubated in an amino acid-free medium, but when reincubated in a complete medium, DNA synthesis resumed at an increasing rate following an initial lag.  The resumption of DNA synthesis could be prevented by the addition of P0ACJ8 to the complete medium.  Exposure of the starved cells to 10000 or 20000 r brought about a similar inhibition of resumption of DNA synthesizing activity, in a response almost identical in pattern to that illustrated for untreated E. coli strain 15/sub T-/.  Thus, interference with protein synthesis led to the apparent exhaustion of a protein (and possibly RNA) that was necessary for resumption of DNA-synthesizing activity.  X-ray exposure or P0ACJ8 prevented the recovery or replacement of the protein activity.  Next a study was undertaken on DNA polymerase and thymidine kinase activity in extracts obtained from cells following the various treatments.  Extracts obtained from E. coli strain 15/sub T-/(555-7) exposed to 40000 r were only slightiy less active in incorporating H/sup 3/-thymidine into DNA than control extracts, and exposure of control extract to 40000 r was only partially inhibitory.  This indicates that destruction of thymidine-phosphorylating enzymes or DNA polymerase cannot account for the complete suppression of DNA synthesis observed in vivo.  In addition, it was shown that pretreatment either by starvation or P0ACJ8 does not lead to gross depletion of polymerase or thymidine kinase activity although as much as a 50% reduction in H/sup 3/-thymidine incorporation activity was sometimes seen in such extracts.
